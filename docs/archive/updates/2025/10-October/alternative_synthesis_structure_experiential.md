## Overview

This alternative structure organizes natal chart interpretation by **experiential domains** rather than traditional life-area sections. It emphasizes the distinction between inner life (private self), outer expression (public self), relational life (connections), and purpose (calling).

**Key Difference from Current Structure**:
- **Current**: Organized by psychological categories (Core Personality, Psychological Makeup, Love, Career, etc.)
- **Alternative**: Organized by experiential domains (Inner Life, Outer Expression, Relational Life, Purpose)

## Implementation Notes

**To create alternative natal-interpreter agent**:
1. Copy natal-interpreter.md to natal-interpreter-experiential.md
2. Replace section structure (lines 120-186) with this experiential domain structure
3. Keep all other instructions identical:
   - 13-point integration formula
   - Universal 3-page standard
   - Process vs synthesis split
   - Voice and tone guidelines
   - Schema v1.1 data references
4. Update mode-orchestrator to recognize both natal-interpreter variants
5. Add profile setting to choose structure preference

**User Selection**:
- Default: Current structure (psychological categories)
- Alternative: Experiential domains (inner/outer/relational/purpose)
- Profile setting: `synthesis_structure: "default" | "experiential"`

---

## Why This Structure Works

**Advantages**:
- More intuitive organization for non-astrologers
- Clear distinction between private and public selves
- Relational life as distinct domain (not split between love/friendship)
- Purpose section brings vocation and meaning together
- Still uses all 13 integration points in each subsection

**Who It's For**:
- People who think in terms of "how I feel inside vs how I show up"
- Therapists and coaches
- People exploring public vs private identity
- Anyone seeking clear life domain organization

---

## Next Steps

1. Get user approval for this structure
2. Create natal-interpreter-experiential.md agent
3. Test with sample profile
4. Add profile setting for structure selection
5. Document in PROFILE_STRUCTURE.md
