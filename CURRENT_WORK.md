## 🎯 Active Work

### Mode 2: Life Arc Report Generator
**Status**: Stage 2 - Profile Integration (COMPLETE ✅) | Stage 3 - Life Arc Calculations (NEXT)

**What We're Building**:
- Comprehensive life timeline report (birth to age 100)
- Shows major life chapters, turning points, success windows
- Combines 6 timing techniques into unified narrative

**Stage 2 Completed**:
- ✅ House ruler calculations added to seed_data_generator.py
- ✅ Created profile_loader.py utility for profile management
  - Load profiles by name
  - Access birth data, planets, houses, aspects, lots, nodes
  - Filter traditional vs modern planets/aspects
  - List available profiles
- ✅ Created comprehensive PROFILES_GUIDE.md documentation
- ✅ Tested all functionality successfully

**Current Task**: Stage 3 - Life Arc Calculations (Beginning)
- Research profections calculation method (annual technique)
- Implement annual profections (age-based house activation)
- Research zodiacal releasing from Fortune/Spirit
- Begin life arc timeline structure
- Test with real birth data

## 📚 Design Documents

**Active**:
- `/docs/life_arc_report_design.md` - 105-page comprehensive design (Stage 0 complete)
- `/docs/seed_data_schema.yaml` - Complete seed data structure
- `/docs/session_goals.md` - North Star vision (maintained by workflow-planner-2)

**Deferred**:
- `/docs/transit_interpretation_design.md` - Transit enhancement research (moved after Life Arc)
- `/docs/transit_staged_implementation.md` - Transit rollout plan (moved after Life Arc)

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes

**Seed Data Strategy**:
- **Structured files** (YAML) for calculated facts
- **RAG database** for traditional interpretations
- **Hybrid approach**: Chat queries both sources
- **Unified generator**: Expands with each mode (natal → life arc → transits)

**Documentation Structure** (NEW):
- `CURRENT_WORK.md` - This file (what's happening NOW)
- `REFERENCE.md` - Static astrology knowledge
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - How to contribute
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `/history/` - Archived completed stages

---

## 🤖 Agent Coordination

**Project-Specific Agents**:
- `docs-updater-astrology` - Updates this file + project docs (being updated for new structure)
- `workflow-planner-2` - Maintains session_goals.md, technical recommendations
- `natal-interpreter` - Generates natal horoscope synthesis
- `astrology-rag-builder` - Maintains RAG database

**Global Agents** (from `~/.claude/agents/`):
- `history-manager` - Archives completed stages to `/history/`

---

## 💡 Remember

- **Synthesis agents** (natal-interpreter, future life-arc agent) require user approval before modification
- **Narrative style preferred**: Flowing prose, not bullet points
- **House rulers critical**: Integrate naturally throughout interpretations
- **Traditional foundation protected**: Modern methods clearly labeled, always secondary
