# Astrology RAG Database Project

## Project Overview

This project creates a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) database for traditional and Hellenistic astrology. The goal is to extract, structure, and index astrological knowledge from authoritative reference books, making it queryable by AI agents for birth chart interpretation and astrological analysis.

### Primary Objectives

1. Extract structured astrological knowledge from foundational reference texts
2. Create a queryable database with semantic search capabilities
3. Maintain source attribution and cross-reference validation
4. Support AI agents in generating accurate, traditional-based astrological interpretations
5. Provide context-aware retrieval for chart delineation, predictive techniques, and timing systems

### Target Use Cases

- Birth chart interpretation (natal astrology)
- Predictive techniques (progressions, profections, transits)
- Dignity and debility assessment
- Aspect analysis and synthesis
- Timing method implementation
- Traditional technique validation

## Astrology Application Project

Building on the RAG database foundation, this project is developing a comprehensive astrology application with three main modes and two rolling chat interfaces.

### Application Vision

**Three Main Modes**:
1. **Natal Horoscope**: Generate comprehensive birth chart interpretations using traditional/Hellenistic methods
2. **Life Arc Report**: Generate comprehensive life timeline from birth to age 100 showing major chapters, turning points, and timing patterns
3. **Transit Report**: Analyze current and upcoming transits with exact timing
4. **Additional Timing Techniques**: Profections, progressions, returns, and other predictive methods

**Two Rolling Chat Interfaces**:
1. **Horoscope Inquirer**: Deep-dive questions about natal chart
2. **Transit/Advice Chatbot**: Transit-specific questions and astrological guidance

**Technical Stack**:
- **Interpretation/Synthesis**: Claude Code agents (natal-interpreter, transit-analyzer, timing technique agents)
- **Astronomical Calculations**: Swiss Ephemeris for planetary positions, houses, aspects, transits
- **Knowledge Base**: RAG database for traditional interpretations
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI API (embeddings only, not for LLM calls)
- **Output**: `/reports/` folder for all generated horoscopes and transit reports
- **Migration Path**: Can migrate to GPT-5 API later if desired; agent instructions serve as approved "prompts"

## User Birth Data Context

**File**: `/Darren_Profile.txt`

Contains natal chart data for the project owner. This is provided as context only and should NOT be used for unsolicited chart analysis. Reference only when explicitly requested for testing, validation, or example purposes.

### Settings Block System

The birth data file now uses a **settings block system** for interpretation customization, replacing CLI input flags. This allows fine-grained control over interpretation depth and methods.

**Settings Block Format**:
```
[SETTINGS]
interpretation_depth: standard|deep|comprehensive
include_house_rulers: true|false
include_lots: basic|extended|full
include_angles_aspects: true|false (toggle if birth time uncertain)
include_nodes: true|false
include_lilith: true|false (default: true, but toggleable)
include_chiron: true|false (default: true, but toggleable)
include_receptions: true|false
include_psychological: basic|deep
modern_methods: conservative|moderate|extensive
```

**Traditional Foundation Protection**:
- All modern methods clearly labeled as supplementary
- Hierarchical interpretation: Traditional primary, modern secondary
- Modern additions never override traditional dignities or core methods
- Hellenistic/traditional foundation remains unchanged
- User can disable modern methods entirely via settings

**Topics Being Researched** (15 total):

**Traditional Methods** (fits current foundation):
1. House Rulers / Derivative Houses
2. Lots / Arabic Parts (extended system)
3. Angles as Chart Points (ASC/MC/DC/IC aspects)

    },
    # ... more eclipses
]
```

### Integration with RAG Database

Agents can now combine Swiss Ephemeris calculations with RAG database queries:

#### Workflow Example

1. **Calculate Current Positions**: Use `get_planetary_positions()` to get current planetary positions
2. **Query RAG Database**: Search database for interpretations of those positions
3. **Calculate Aspects**: Use `calculate_aspect()` to find aspects between planets
4. **Query Aspect Interpretations**: Search database for aspect delineations
5. **Calculate Transits**: Use `calculate_transit()` for transit analysis
6. **Query Transit Interpretations**: Search database for transit meanings
7. **Synthesize**: Combine ephemeris data with traditional delineations

#### Example Integration

```python
from scripts.ephemeris_helper import get_planetary_positions, calculate_aspect
from datetime import datetime

# Get current positions
positions = get_planetary_positions(datetime.utcnow())

# Extract Mars and Saturn positions
mars_long = positions['Mars']['longitude']
saturn_long = positions['Saturn']['longitude']

# Calculate aspect
aspect = calculate_aspect(mars_long, saturn_long)

if aspect and aspect['aspect'] == 'square':
    # Query RAG database for "Mars square Saturn" interpretations
    # Combine with current positions, signs, retrograde status
    # Generate interpretation using traditional delineations
    pass
```

### Traditional Astrology Compliance

The Swiss Ephemeris integration maintains alignment with traditional astrological principles:

**Whole-Sign Houses**: Default house system ('W')
- Each house spans exactly 30¬∞ (one sign)
- Rising sign = entire 1st house
- Consistent with Hellenistic practice

**Classical Aspects Only**:
- Conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition
- No modern aspects (quintile, septile, etc.)
- Traditional orbs enforced

**Retrograde Detection**:
- Accurate retrograde status for all planets
- Essential for traditional interpretation
- Speed values indicate daily motion

**Traditional Orbs**:
- Conjunction/Opposition: 10¬∞ maximum
- Square/Trine: 7-8¬∞ recommended
- Sextile: 6-8¬∞ recommended
- Configurable via function parameters

**Sect Awareness**:
- Day/night chart determination via Sun position
- Ascendant calculation for sect light identification
- Foundation for benefic/malefic sect analysis (in development)

**Traditional Seven Planets**:
- Sun through Saturn as primary
- Modern planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) as secondary
- Consistent with project's traditional focus

### Testing and Verification

The ephemeris helper script has been tested and verified for accuracy.

**Test the Script**:
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "/Users/darrenschaeffer/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Astrogy_Claude"

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run test script
python scripts/ephemeris_helper.py
```

**Expected Output**:
- Current planetary positions
- Sample house calculations
- Sample aspect calculations
- Sample transit data
- Upcoming eclipse dates

**Verification**:
- Compare output with astronomical ephemeris tables
- Cross-check with astrology software (Astro.com, Solar Fire, etc.)
- Verify retrograde stations against published data
- Confirm eclipse dates with NASA eclipse data

### Error Handling

The helper script includes error handling for common issues:

**Missing Ephemeris Files**: Built-in ephemeris data used automatically

**Invalid Date Ranges**: Ephemeris data typically covers 1800-2400 CE

**Invalid Coordinates**: Latitude must be -90¬∞ to +90¬∞, longitude -180¬∞ to +180¬∞

**Invalid Planet Names**: Validation against supported planet list

**Time Zone Issues**: Always prefer UTC for consistency

### Performance Considerations

**Initialization**: Swiss Ephemeris files loaded once per session

**Calculation Speed**: Astronomical calculations are fast (<1ms per planet)

**Resource Cleanup**: Call `cleanup()` when finished to close ephemeris files

**Batch Calculations**: For multiple dates, reuse function calls efficiently

### Future Enhancements

**Planned Features**:
- Progressed positions (secondary progressions, solar arc)

### Usage for Agents

Import reference data and helper functions directly:

```python
from scripts.astrology_reference import (
    PLANETS, SIGNS, HOUSES, ASPECTS,
    check_dignity, get_triplicity_ruler, get_bounds_ruler
)

# Check dignity
dignity = check_dignity('Mars', 'Aries')  # Returns: 'domicile'

# Get planet data
mars_data = PLANETS['Mars']
print(mars_data['keywords'])  # ['action', 'conflict', 'desire', 'courage', 'aggression', 'severance']

# Get sign ruler
ruler = get_sign_ruler('Scorpio')  # Returns: 'Mars'

# Get house topics
topics = get_house_topics(1)  # Returns: ['body', 'appearance', 'vitality', 'character', ...]

# Check triplicity
fire_ruler = get_triplicity_ruler('Fire', 'diurnal')  # Returns: 'Sun'

# Get bounds ruler
bounds = get_bounds_ruler('Aries', 10)  # Returns: 'Venus' (Aries 6-14¬∞ is Venus bounds)

# Get decan ruler
decan = get_decan_ruler('Leo', 15)  # Returns: 'Jupiter' (Leo 10-20¬∞ is Jupiter decan)

# Check combustion
is_combust = check_combust(planet_long=120.5, sun_long=125.0)  # Returns: True (within 8.5¬∞)

# Get sect status
status = get_sect_status('Jupiter', 'diurnal')  # Returns: 'of sect'
```

### Integration with Other Systems

The static reference data complements:

1. **RAG Database**: Use reference for lookups, RAG for interpretations
   - Reference: "What sign does Mars rule?" ‚Üí Quick lookup
   - RAG: "What does Mars in Aries mean?" ‚Üí Semantic search

2. **Swiss Ephemeris**: Use ephemeris for calculations, reference for context
   - Ephemeris: Calculate current Mars position ‚Üí 15¬∞ Scorpio
   - Reference: Check dignity ‚Üí Mars in domicile
   - RAG: Query interpretation ‚Üí "Mars in Scorpio in domicile..."

3. **Workflow Example**:
   ```python
   from scripts.ephemeris_helper import get_planetary_positions
   from scripts.astrology_reference import check_dignity, PLANETS
   from datetime import datetime

   # Calculate positions
   positions = get_planetary_positions(datetime.utcnow())
   mars_sign = positions['Mars']['sign']
   mars_long = positions['Mars']['longitude']

   # Check dignity
   dignity = check_dignity('Mars', mars_sign)

   # Get interpretation context
   mars_keywords = PLANETS['Mars']['keywords']

   # Query RAG database with context
   query = f"Mars in {mars_sign}"
   if dignity:
       query += f" in {dignity}"
   # ... query RAG database for interpretation
   ```

### Benefits

1. **Fast Lookups**: No semantic search needed for factual data
2. **Single Source of Truth**: All static data in one authoritative location
3. **Type Safety**: Python dictionaries with consistent structure
4. **Direct Access**: Import and use immediately
5. **No Parsing**: Pre-structured data, no text processing
6. **Extensible**: Easy to add new data or functions
7. **Exportable**: Can convert to JSON for non-Python uses

### Data Accuracy

All dignity tables, planetary data, and significations are based on traditional and Hellenistic sources:
- Egyptian Bounds: Traditional tables
- Decans: Chaldean order
- Triplicity: Dorothean system
- Sect assignments: Hellenistic practice
- Modern planets: Clearly marked, no traditional dignities

### Testing

Test the reference module:
```bash
cd "/Users/darrenschaeffer/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Astrogy_Claude"
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/astrology_reference.py
```

Expected output includes example lookups demonstrating all helper functions.

---

## Quality Control

### OCR Error Detection

**Issue**: Robert Hand's "Planets in Transit" is OCR'd and may contain errors.

**Detection methods**:
- Dictionary validation for common words
- Known astrological term validation
- Pattern matching for typical OCR errors:
  - "rn" ‚Üí "m"
  - "l" ‚Üí "1" or "I"
  - "0" ‚Üí "O"
  - Broken words
  - Missing spaces

**Correction strategy**:
- Manual review of flagged passages
- Context-based correction suggestions
- Cross-reference with other sources for validation

### Cross-Reference Validation

**Process**:
1. Extract same topic from multiple sources
2. Compare interpretations
3. Flag significant discrepancies
4. Note tradition differences (Hellenistic vs. Modern)
5. Preserve both interpretations with clear attribution

**Example**:
```json
{
  "topic": "Mars in Cancer",
  "sources": [
    {
      "source": "Hellenistic Astrology",
      "interpretation": "Mars in fall, weakened, difficulty taking action",
      "tradition": "Hellenistic"
    },
    {
      "source": "Modern Astrology Text",
      "interpretation": "Protective action, emotional assertiveness",
      "tradition": "Modern"
    }
  ],
  "discrepancy": "Traditional views Mars as debilitated; modern views as emotionally expressive",
  "resolution": "Both valid within their traditions; prefer traditional for this project"
}
```

### Contradiction Flagging

**Types of contradictions**:
1. **Technical**: Different dignity assignments, aspect orbs
2. **Interpretive**: Conflicting delineations
3. **Traditional**: Hellenistic vs. Medieval vs. Modern differences
4. **Calculation**: Formula variations

**Flagging system**:
```json
{
  "contradiction_id": "unique-id",
  "type": "interpretive",
  "topic": "Saturn in 5th house",
  "conflicting_sources": [
    {"source": "Source A", "view": "Delays children", "tradition": "Traditional"},
    {"source": "Source B", "view": "Responsible parenting", "tradition": "Modern"}
  ],
  "resolution": "Traditional interpretation takes precedence for this project",
  "notes": "Modern psychological view noted as secondary"
}
```

### Tradition Markers

Every extracted piece of content is marked with its astrological tradition:

**Tradition categories**:
- **Hellenistic**: Greco-Roman astrology (1st century BCE - 7th century CE)
- **Medieval**: Arabic and European medieval astrology (8th - 17th century)
- **Traditional**: Pre-modern astrology using traditional techniques
- **Modern**: Post-17th century astrology (especially psychological)
- **Contemporary**: Current traditional revival (Hellenistic focus)

**Marker application**:
```json
{
  "text": "Mars in Cancer is in fall...",
  "tradition": "Hellenistic",
  "tradition_markers": ["dignity", "fall", "essential dignity"],
  "modern_applicable": false
}
```

---

## Edge Cases

### Modern Planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto)

**Handling strategy**:
- Extract interpretations as **secondary content only**
- Never assign as primary rulers
- Never include in essential dignity schemes
- Mark all content with `modern_planet: true` flag
- Use for supplementary interpretation only

**Example**:
```json
{
  "planet": "Uranus",
  "modern_planet": true,
  "secondary_ruler": "Aquarius (modern only)",
  "traditional_ruler": "Saturn (primary)",
  "usage": "Supplementary interpretation only",
  "note": "Not used for essential dignities or primary chart analysis"
}
```

### Multi-Source Synthesis

When multiple sources address the same topic:

**Strategy**:
1. Extract all interpretations separately with full attribution
2. Create synthesis entries that note commonalities
3. Preserve source-specific nuances
4. Note tradition differences
5. Flag contradictions

**Example structure**:
```json
{
  "synthesis_id": "mars-square-saturn-001",
  "topic": "Mars square Saturn",
  "common_themes": ["frustration", "delayed action", "discipline"],
  "source_variations": [
    {
      "source": "Hellenistic Astrology",
      "emphasis": "Malefic-malefic conflict, sect considerations"
    },
    {
      "source": "Planets in Transit",
      "emphasis": "Constructive frustration, building endurance"
    }
  ],
  "recommended_interpretation": "Combines traditional dignity assessment with modern psychological insight"
}
```

### Example/Case Study Preservation

Chart examples from source texts are valuable and should be preserved:

**Extraction requirements**:
- Full chart data (date, time, place if available)
- Interpretation context from source
- Technique being demonstrated
- Historical or celebrity context
- Source attribution

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "example_id": "unique-id",
  "source": "Hellenistic Astrology",
  "page": 456,
  "chart_data": {
    "date": "1969-07-20",
    "time": "20:17",
    "place": "Sea of Tranquility, Moon",
    "context": "Apollo 11 Moon landing"
  },
  "technique_demonstrated": "Annual profections",
  "interpretation": "Example shows profected Ascendant activating 9th house of travel...",
  "teaching_point": "Demonstrates profection timing for major event"
}
```

### Orb Variations

Different sources use different orbs for aspects:

**Strategy**:
- Extract orb specifications from each source
- Note source-specific orb ranges
- Provide default/recommended orbs
- Allow flexible orb queries

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "aspect": "trine",
  "orb_ranges": [
    {"source": "Hellenistic Astrology", "orb": 7, "context": "whole sign aspects"},
    {"source": "Modern source", "orb": 8, "context": "degree-based"},
    {"source": "Transit work", "orb": 5, "context": "applying aspects only"}
  ],
  "recommended_orb": 7,
  "notes": "Whole-sign aspects may not use orbs; degree-based work typically 7-8¬∞"
}
```

### Documentation Hierarchy

**session_goals.md** (North Star) ‚Üí **/docs/** (detailed specifications) ‚Üí **CLAUDE.md** (current state)

- **session_goals.md**: Vision, technical approach, simple strategic direction (owned by workflow-planner-2)
- **/docs/**: Design documents, staged implementation plans, technical details
- **CLAUDE.md**: Current progress, system catalog, references to detailed docs (owned by docs-updater-astrology)

### Astrological Interpretation Agents

**Purpose**: Claude Code agents provide interpretation and synthesis for the astrology application. Scripts handle calculations and data retrieval, then call agents to synthesize traditional delineations into cohesive interpretations.

**Architectural Decision**: Using Claude Code agents (not GPT-5 API) for MVP
- No external API calls needed
- Faster (no network latency)
- Better quality (Claude excels at synthesis)
- Easier to test and iterate
- Agent instructions = approved "prompts"
- Can migrate to GPT-5 API later if desired

**natal-interpreter (Purple)** - ACTIVE ‚úÖ
- Location: `.claude/agents/natal-interpreter.md`
- Purpose: Generate comprehensive natal psychological profiles using traditional/Hellenistic methods
- Model: Sonnet
- Color: Purple
- Created: Stage 1.1
- Key features:
  - Two-part output: Accessible synthesis (no jargon) + Technical analysis (full astrological detail)
  - RAG database integration for traditional interpretations
  - Sect-based interpretation with planetary strength assessment
  - Hellenistic foundation with modern psychological overlay
  - Scales depth with available data
  - Footnoted citations for all interpretations
- Output structure:
  - I. Chart Overview (technical)

- Successfully tested with Darren's natal chart

**Transit Analyzer** (to be created in future stage)
- Location: `/agents/transit_analyzer_README.md` (will be created)
- Purpose: Current and upcoming transit analysis with timing
- Workflow: Receive natal + transit data ‚Üí Query RAG ‚Üí Synthesize interpretations ‚Üí Generate report
- Called by: `transit_report.py` script
- Instructions require user approval before agent is created

**Timing Technique Agents** (to be created in future stages)
- Profections Interpreter
- Zodiacal Releasing Interpreter
- Progressions Interpreter
- Each agent receives calculation results and synthesizes traditional interpretations

### Agent Coordination Pattern

1. User + workflow-planner-2 discover approach and make recommendations
2. workflow-planner-2 recommends specific tools/frameworks/agents/architecture
3. docs-updater-astrology catalogs recommendations in CLAUDE.md
4. Implementation agents execute work using helper scripts and RAG database
5. docs-updater-astrology updates CLAUDE.md with progress
6. When stages complete, docs-updater-astrology updates with next stage plan

### Agent Documentation Pattern

- Each agent creates and maintains its own README in the `/agents/` directory
- Agent READMEs document: purpose, workflow steps, usage examples, known limitations
- Agents update their READMEs as they learn and improve
- This file serves as a central index pointing to agent documentation
- See `/agents/README.md` for complete system architecture, workflows, and helper script integration

## Development Guidelines

### For AI Agents Working on This Project

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Astrology Information Sources

**ALL astrology information lookups, fact-checking, and research MUST use ONLY local references:**

1. **RAG Database**: `/output/database/astrology_rag_database.jsonl`
   - Primary source for interpretations and delineations
   - Use `scripts/query_rag_database.py` for semantic search

2. **Reference PDFs**: `/Referendces/` folder
   - Hellenistic Astrology (Chris Brennan)
   - Demetra George - Astrology and the Authentic Self
   - Robert Hand - Planets in Transit
   - Bernadette Brady - Predictive Astrology
   - Sophia Mason - Delineation of Progressions
   - Liz Greene - The Horoscope in Manifestation

3. **Static Reference Module**: `/scripts/astrology_reference.py`
   - Essential dignities (domicile, exaltation, detriment, fall, triplicity, bounds, decans)
   - Planetary data and significations
   - Sign and house attributes
   - Aspect definitions and orbs
   - Sect, conditions, and lots

**NEVER use external web searches or online resources for astrology information.** All interpretations must be grounded in the traditional sources provided in this project.

#### Before Starting Extraction
1. Review this CLAUDE.md document thoroughly
2. Understand the astrological systems and terminology
3. Check the controlled vocabulary and synonym mappings
4. Review example structures for each building block
5. Verify access to reference PDFs in `/Referendces/`
6. Review Swiss Ephemeris Integration section for live astronomical data access

#### During Extraction
1. Maintain strict adherence to controlled vocabulary
2. Apply synonym mapping consistently
3. Tag all content with complete metadata
4. Preserve source attribution with page numbers
5. Flag contradictions and edge cases
6. Use semantic chunking (200-800 tokens, 50-token overlap)
7. Apply tradition markers to all content

#### Quality Checks
1. Validate entity extraction accuracy
2. Check metadata completeness
3. Verify cross-references
4. Test query retrieval for sample topics
5. Review OCR-heavy sections (Hand book) carefully
6. Ensure JSON schema compliance

#### Output Requirements
1. Valid JSON/JSONL format
2. Consistent metadata structure
3. Complete source attribution
4. Controlled vocabulary compliance
5. Vector embeddings generated via OpenAI API
6. Quality control documentation

#### Swiss Ephemeris Access for Agents

Agents can access live astronomical calculations through the ephemeris helper script at `/Users/darrenschaeffer/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Astrogy_Claude/scripts/ephemeris_helper.py`.

**Available Capabilities**:
- Calculate current planetary positions for any date/time
- Compute house cusps for specific locations (default: whole-sign houses)
- Calculate aspects between planetary positions
- Determine transits to natal positions
- Find eclipse dates (lunar and solar)
- Convert between datetime and Julian day numbers
- Format positions in traditional astrological notation

**Integration Workflow**:
1. Use ephemeris helper to calculate current/historical positions
2. Query RAG database for interpretations of those positions
3. Combine ephemeris data with traditional delineations from source texts
4. Generate comprehensive interpretations using both systems

**Example Use Cases**:
- Chart interpretation: Calculate positions, then retrieve delineations from database
- Transit analysis: Calculate current transits, query database for transit interpretations
- Aspect analysis: Calculate aspects between planets, retrieve aspect meanings
- Timing techniques: Use ephemeris for date-based calculations (progressions, profections)
- Chart examples: Verify chart data from source texts using ephemeris calculations

**Important Notes**:
- Always use UTC for consistency in astronomical calculations
- Default house system is whole-sign ('W') to match project standards
- Only classical aspects are calculated (no modern aspects)
- Modern planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) available but marked as secondary
- Call `cleanup()` when finished with ephemeris calculations to free resources

See the "Swiss Ephemeris Integration" section above for complete function reference and usage examples.

#### Static Reference Data Access for Agents

Agents can access all static astrological reference data through the astrology reference module at `/Users/darrenschaeffer/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Astrogy_Claude/scripts/astrology_reference.py`.

**Available Data**:
- Complete essential dignity tables (domicile, exaltation, triplicity, bounds, decans)
- Planetary profiles with significations, sect status, and keywords
- Sign data with elements, modalities, rulers, and qualities
- House significations and topics (all 12 houses)
- Classical aspect definitions with traditional orbs
- Sect assignments and planetary conditions
- Lot/part calculation formulas

**Helper Functions** (19 total):
- `check_dignity(planet, sign)` - Check dignity status
- `get_planet_dignities(planet)` - Get all dignities for planet
- `get_triplicity_ruler(element, chart_type)` - Get triplicity ruler by sect
- `get_bounds_ruler(sign, degree)` - Get bounds ruler for degree
- `get_decan_ruler(sign, degree)` - Get decan ruler for degree
- `get_sect_status(planet, chart_type)` - Get sect status
- `check_combust()`, `check_cazimi()`, `check_under_beams()` - Condition checks
- And 10 more utility functions

**Integration Workflow**:
1. Import reference module for static lookups
2. Use for dignity checks, ruler lookups, condition verification
3. Combine with ephemeris for calculations
4. Query RAG database for interpretations

**Example Usage**:
```python
from scripts.astrology_reference import check_dignity, PLANETS, get_bounds_ruler
from scripts.ephemeris_helper import get_planetary_positions
from datetime import datetime

# Calculate current positions
positions = get_planetary_positions(datetime.utcnow())
mars_sign = positions['Mars']['sign']
mars_degree = positions['Mars']['degree_in_sign']

# Check dignity from reference
dignity = check_dignity('Mars', mars_sign)

# Get bounds ruler
bounds = get_bounds_ruler(mars_sign, mars_degree)

# Get keywords from reference
keywords = PLANETS['Mars']['keywords']

# Build query for RAG database
query = f"Mars in {mars_sign}"
if dignity:
    query += f" in {dignity}"
# ... query RAG for interpretation
```

**When to Use Reference vs RAG**:
- **Reference Module**: Factual lookups (rulers, dignities, house topics, aspect orbs)
- **RAG Database**: Interpretations, delineations, technique instructions

See the "Static Astrology Reference Data" section above for complete data structures and function reference.

### Important Reminders

**Traditional Focus**: This is a traditional/Hellenistic astrology project. Modern psychological interpretations are secondary.

**Whole-Sign Houses**: All house placements use whole-sign system exclusively.

**Seven Planets**: Traditional seven planets are primary; modern planets are supplementary only.

**Attribution**: Every interpretation must cite source, author, and page number.

**Dignity Priority**: Essential dignities are fundamental; always extract and validate dignity tables.

**Sect Matters**: Sect considerations are critical for interpretation; always note day/night chart context.

**No Unsolicited Analysis**: Do not analyze the user's birth chart (`Darren_Profile.txt`) unless explicitly requested.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent Instructions Approval Workflow

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All Claude Code agent **instructions** that the application will use must be shown to user for approval BEFORE agents are created.

**Architectural Context**:
- **MVP Approach**: Using Claude Code agents (not GPT-5 API) for interpretation/synthesis
- Agent instructions = the "prompts" that control agent output
- Scripts calculate/query data, then call agents for synthesis
- Can migrate to GPT-5 API later if desired

**What this means:**
- We're approving **agent instruction documents** (the agent definitions)
- NOT conversations during development/building
- The workflow is: design agent instructions ‚Üí show for approval ‚Üí user approves/modifies ‚Üí create agent ‚Üí scripts call agent

**When this applies:**
- All Mode 1 (Natal Horoscope Generator) agent instructions
- All Mode 2 (Transit Report Generator) agent instructions
- All Mode 3+ (Timing Techniques) agent instructions
- All Stage 3+ (n8n integration or chat interface) agent instructions if applicable

**Workflow:**
1. Agent (or agent-creator) builds complete agent **instruction document** with all components:
   - Agent purpose and role
   - System instructions (how to interpret, synthesize, format)
   - Input data structure (how chart/transit/timing data will be provided)
   - Output format requirements (horoscope structure, sections, tone)
   - RAG database query integration (what to query, how to synthesize)
   - Traditional astrology compliance requirements
   - Example workflows

2. Agent presents instruction document to user with:
   - Clear section labels (Purpose, Instructions, Input Format, Output Format, RAG Integration, Examples)
   - Explanation of what this agent will generate when called by scripts
   - Example input/output scenarios
   - Traditional astrology compliance notes

3. Agent STOPS and waits for user approval/modifications

4. User reviews and either:
   - Approves ‚Üí Agent is created with approved instructions
   - Requests changes ‚Üí Agent modifies instructions and presents again
   - Rejects ‚Üí Agent is not created

**Purpose:**
- Quality control over all AI-generated horoscope content that the application produces
- Ensures agent instructions match user's vision and expectations
- Allows iterative refinement of agent design before implementation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Synthesis Agent Modification Policy

**CRITICAL**: Agents that generate final synthesis output (horoscopes, reports, interpretations) must NOT be modified without explicit user approval.

**Affected agents**:
- `natal-interpreter` - Generates natal horoscope synthesis
- `transit-analyzer` - Generates transit report synthesis
- Any future synthesis/interpretation agents

**Why this matters**:
- These agents control the **tone, style, and structure** of the final output the user receives
- Changes to these agents can dramatically alter the user experience
- User needs to maintain consistent output quality and style across all generated horoscopes

**Process for modifications**:
1. **Identify the need**: User requests change OR you identify an issue/improvement
2. **Propose changes**: Present proposed modifications to user with clear before/after examples
3. **Get approval**: Wait for explicit user approval before implementing
4. **Document changes**: Note what was changed and why in the agent file header

**What requires approval**:
- Changes to output structure (sections, subsections, formatting)
- Changes to tone or writing style
- Changes to content inclusion/exclusion
- Changes to narrative flow or organization
- Changes to technical detail level

**What does NOT require approval** (but inform user):
- Bug fixes that don't change output
- Updates to internal logic that maintain same output
- Performance optimizations
- Corrections to factual astrological errors

**Example workflow**:
```
User: "The horoscope doesn't look right. The career section doesn't mention house rulers."
Assistant: "I see the issue. The natal-interpreter agent isn't emphasizing house rulers.
           I'd like to propose adding house ruler analysis to the career section.
           This would add language like: 'Your 10th house is ruled by Venus in the 5th,
           indicating career through creativity.'
           Should I make this change?"
User: "Yes, but make sure it's naturally integrated, not technical jargon."
Assistant: [Makes approved change, documents it]
```

### üìã Documentation Update Protocol

**After every major step, ALWAYS update ALL documentation using the docs-updater-astrology agent:**

**Major steps include:**
- Completing any implementation stage (Stage -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.)
- Adding new features, modes, or CLI commands
- Making architecture or technology decisions
- Discovering critical findings
- Adding/modifying agents or tools
- Completing milestones or sub-stages

**What to update:**
1. **CLAUDE.md** (via docs-updater-astrology agent):
   - Current Status section (mark stages complete ‚úÖ)
   - Version History (add new version entry)
   - References to new design docs
   - System component catalog (if changed)

2. **session_goals.md** (via docs-updater-astrology agent for PROGRESS):
   - Mark completed stages/sub-stages as ‚úÖ or COMPLETE
   - Update "Deliverables" sections with checkmarks
   - Track what has been implemented
   - Update "Status" fields (Planning ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí COMPLETE ‚úÖ)
   - Add completion timestamps
   - Update "Next Stage" or current stage pointers
   - Keep implementation progress current
   - **Do NOT modify plan structure** (that's workflow-planner-2's job)

3. **Relevant README files** (via docs-updater-astrology):
   - `/agents/[agent]_README.md` if agent capabilities changed
   - Any other affected documentation

**Agent Division of Labor for session_goals.md:**
- **workflow-planner-2**: Creates plan structure, defines stages, makes recommendations (does NOT mark progress)
- **docs-updater-astrology**: Marks progress, checks off deliverables, updates status (does NOT change plan)

**How to trigger:**
- Use the docs-updater-astrology agent proactively
- Don't wait for user to request updates
- Update immediately when major work completes
- Update ALL three documentation types (CLAUDE.md + session_goals.md + READMEs)

This ensures documentation always reflects current project state.

## Environment Configuration

**API Credentials**: Stored in `.env` file in project root

Required variables:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**OpenAI API Usage**:
- **Embeddings only**: Used for RAG database vector embeddings (text-embedding-3-large or similar)
- **NOT used for LLM calls**: Interpretation/synthesis handled by Claude Code agents
- Required for RAG database queries and semantic search
- No usage for chat completion or text generation in MVP

**Multi-Profile System**:

The project now supports multiple user profiles with isolated directories for birth data, seed data, and outputs.

**Directory Structure**:
```
/profiles/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ darren/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile.md               # Birth data and settings (markdown format)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seed_data/               # Enhanced interpretations (input for agents)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ natal_interpretation_enhanced.md
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output/                  # Final horoscopes and reports
  ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ natal_horoscope_synthesis.md

  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seed_data/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Automated Horoscope Generation Workflow

**When user requests a natal horoscope**, the system automatically performs all steps without verification:

1. **Create profile** (if new person) - `create_profile.py` with birth data
2. **Apply settings** - Chiron, Lilith, technical_sections as requested
3. **Generate seed data** - `natal_interpreter.py --profile [name]`
4. **Generate synthesis** - natal-interpreter agent
5. **Create PDF** - `create_synthesis_pdf.py --profile [name]`
6. **Deliver result** - Show location of markdown + PDF files

**User request format**: "Create a natal horoscope for [person], [birth data], exclude [chiron/lilith/technical sections]"

**Example**:
```
User: "Create a natal horoscope for my sister. 8/5/1991, 6:30 PM, Samcheok-si, South Korea 37.4441¬∞ N, 129.1679¬∞ E. Exclude chiron, lilith, and technical sections."

System response:
1. Creates profile at /profiles/sister/
2. Generates seed data
3. Generates horoscope synthesis
4. Creates PDF
5. Shows: "‚úÖ Horoscope complete! Files at /profiles/sister/output/"
```

**No verification step** - complete horoscope generation is fully automated.

---

**Creating New Profiles** (`scripts/create_profile.py`):

Automatically create new profiles with calculated chart data:

```bash
python scripts/create_profile.py --name "mom" \
    --date "2/9/1960" \
    --time "2:30 PM" \
    --location "Linton, ND" \
    --lat 46.267 \
    --lon -100.233 \
    --timezone "CST"
```

This script:
- Creates directory structure (`seed_data/` and `output/`)
- Calculates all planetary positions using Swiss Ephemeris
- Calculates house cusps (whole-sign system)
- Generates `profile.md` with complete chart data
- Sets default settings (customize after creation)

**Supported timezones**: EST, CST, MST, PST, UTC

**Coordinate format**:
- Latitude: Positive = North, Negative = South
- Longitude: Positive = East, Negative = West

See `/profiles/README.md` for complete documentation.

**Profile Loader** (`scripts/profile_loader.py`):
- `load_profile(name)` - Load specific profile
- `get_default_profile()` - Get default profile (prefers 'darren', then alphabetically first)
- `list_profiles()` - List all available profiles

**Profile Object Methods**:
- `profile.get_seed_data_path(filename)` - Get path to seed data file
- `profile.get_output_path(filename)` - Get path to output file
- `profile.settings` - Parsed settings from [INTERPRETATION_SETTINGS] block

**Usage in Scripts**:
```python
from scripts.profile_loader import get_default_profile

# Load default profile
profile = get_default_profile()

# Get paths
seed_path = profile.get_seed_data_path('natal_interpretation_enhanced.md')
output_path = profile.get_output_path('natal_horoscope_synthesis.md')

# Access settings
if profile.settings['technical_sections']:
    # Include technical sections
    pass
```

**Legacy Paths** (Deprecated):
- Old single-user files in `/output/` are deprecated
- Old `Darren_Profile.txt` in root is deprecated
- All new work uses `/profiles/[name]/` structure

**Project Root**:
- `/Users/darrenschaeffer/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Astrogy_Claude`

## Glossary of Astrological Terms

For AI agents unfamiliar with astrology, this glossary provides essential definitions:

**Angular**: Houses 1, 4, 7, 10 (strongest house positions)

**Applying aspect**: Aspect forming as planets move toward exactness

**Bounds/Terms**: Division of each sign into 5 unequal segments ruled by different planets

**Cadent**: Houses 3, 6, 9, 12 (weakest house positions)

**Cazimi**: Planet within 17 minutes of the Sun (empowered)

**Combust**: Planet within 8.5¬∞ of the Sun (weakened)

**Decans/Faces**: Division of each sign into three 10¬∞ segments

**Detriment**: Planet in sign opposite its domicile (weakened)

**Dignity**: Any condition strengthening a planet (essential or accidental)

**Diurnal**: Day chart (Sun above horizon at birth)

**Domicile**: Planet in its own sign (strongest essential dignity)

**Essential dignity**: Strength from zodiacal position (sign-based)

**Exaltation**: Planet in sign of exaltation (second-strongest dignity)

**Fall**: Planet in sign opposite its exaltation (weakened)

**Lot**: Calculated point using formula (Ascendant + Planet A - Planet B)

**Malefic**: Harmful planet (Mars, Saturn traditionally)

**Nocturnal**: Night chart (Sun below horizon at birth)

**Profection**: Annual time-lord system (advance 1 house per year of life)

**Progression**: Predictive system (1 day after birth = 1 year of life)

**Reception**: Planet in sign ruled by another planet

**Retrograde**: Apparent backward motion of planet

**Sect**: Division of planets by day/night chart affinity

**Separating aspect**: Aspect moving past exactness

**Succedent**: Houses 2, 5, 8, 11 (moderate house positions)

**Transit**: Current planetary position relative to natal chart

**Triplicity**: Elemental dignity (fire, earth, air, water rulers)

**Under the beams**: Planet within 15¬∞ of Sun (obscured)

**Whole-sign houses**: House system where each house = one complete sign

**Version 1.11** - 2025-10-05
- **Major Course Change**: Pivoted to implement Life Arc Report before Transit Report
- Updated application modes: Mode 2 is now Life Arc Report, Mode 3 is Transit Report
- **Life Arc Report Stage 0 Complete**: Research and design complete (105+ pages)
- Key Life Arc features:
  - 10-lot Hellenistic system (Fortune, Spirit, Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory, Exaltation, Marriage, Children, Basis)
  - 6 timing techniques (ZR, Saturn Returns, Jupiter Returns, Outer Planet Milestones, Progressed Lunation, Key Profections)
  - 4-tier event prioritization system
  - Birth to age 100 timeline
  - Technical document (50-100+ pages) + Synthesis PDF (15-25 pages with graphics)
  - 7-stage implementation plan (~5-6 weeks)
- Updated Design Documents section to show Life Arc as current focus
- Marked Transit Report design as deferred (after Life Arc)
- Added note that session_goals.md needs updating by workflow-planner-2
- Ready to begin Life Arc Stage 1 (Core Calculation Engine)

**Version 1.10** - 2025-10-04
- **Stage 1.1 Complete**: Created natal-interpreter agent
- Added natal-interpreter to Agents catalog (Purple, Sonnet model)
- Two-part output structure (accessible synthesis + technical analysis)
- RAG database integration, sect-based interpretation
- Architecture clarification: NOT proactive (called explicitly by scripts)
- Successfully tested with Darren's natal chart

**Version 1.9** - 2025-10-04
- **Major Architectural Decision**: Using Claude Code agents instead of GPT-5 API for interpretation/synthesis in MVP
- Renamed "GPT-5 Prompt Approval Workflow" ‚Üí "Agent Instructions Approval Workflow"
- Scripts calculate/query, then call agents for synthesis
- Can migrate to GPT-5 API later if desired

**Version 1.8** - 2025-10-04
- Added critical workflow requirement: Agent Instructions Approval (production agents only)
- All Mode 1, 2, 3+ agent instructions require approval before creation
- Purpose: Quality control over production output
- Note: Version 1.9 supersedes this with architectural change to Claude Code agents

**Version 1.7** - 2025-10-04
- Infrastructure improvement: Created agent-creator meta-agent
- Conversational agent creation (instead of `/agents` command)
- Automatically triggers docs-updater-astrology after creating agents

**Version 1.6** - 2025-10-04
- Infrastructure improvement: Added proactive triggers to astrology-rag-builder agent
- All critical agents now have automatic triggers
