# Astrology Application - Session Goals

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Planning Stage

---

## Speculative Updates (Future Features)

Features we may implement but haven't fully planned yet:

- **Claude Code API instead of ChatGPT**: Migrate from OpenAI to Claude API
- **Birth data entry in chat interface**: Allow users to enter birth data during chat, automation fetches natal data
- **Transit story/activation timeline**: Expand transit reports to include the totality of a transit's story in the native's life (transits tell stories, not isolated events)
- **Module refinement**: After initial build, go back and refine individual modules
- **Synastry**: Add relationship compatibility analysis
- **Mobile app consideration**: May build over Telegram if we need to adjust settings
- **Different input/output modes**: Various ways to interact with the system
- **Electional astrology**: Add chart selection for optimal timing (doesn't help with transits, so later priority)

---

## North Star Vision

Build a comprehensive astrology application that provides:
1. **Natal Horoscope Generator**: Personalized birth chart interpretation
2. **Transit Report Generator**: Targeted transit analysis by area of life and timeframe
3. **Additional Timing Techniques**: Zodiacal releasing, annual profections, and other traditional methods
4. **Interactive Chat Interfaces**: Two rolling conversation modes
   - **Horoscope Inquirer**: Chat about natal chart, personality, ideal vocation
   - **Transit/Advice Chatbot**: Chat about current situation, transits, and advice

**Ultimate Goal**: Make traditional/Hellenistic astrology insights accessible through natural conversation, grounded in authoritative sources (Brennan, Hand, George, Brady, Greene).

**User Context**: Deep astrology expertise, limited coding experience. Need expert technical guidance to implement vision.

**Workflow**: Start in Claude Code ‚Üí migrate to web/Telegram if successful

---

## Recommended Technical Approach

### Architecture: Session-Based Command System

**Mental Model**: Like a doctor's appointment
- Doctor reviews your file at start (loads natal chart + base analysis)
- You tell them what you need (horoscope, transit report, timing analysis, or ask questions)
- They pull relevant info and give you specific answers
- Your file stays loaded the whole visit (session persists)

### System Components

```
Session Manager (Orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Loads natal chart at session start
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Maintains session context
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Routes commands to appropriate modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mode 1: Natal Horoscope Generator
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mode 2: Transit Report Generator
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mode 3+: Additional Timing Techniques (zodiacal releasing, profections, etc.)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chat Mode A: Horoscope Inquirer (chat about natal chart)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Chat Mode B: Transit/Advice Chatbot (chat about transits + current situation)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ All modules use:
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chart_analyzer.py
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transit_calculator.py
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interpretation_builder.py (RAG)
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ephemeris_helper.py
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ astrology_reference.py
```

### Mode Breakdown

**Mode 1: Natal Horoscope Generator**
- Input: Birth data file path
- Process:
  1. Generate seed info (natal analysis with dignities, sect, strength)
  2. Query RAG for each planet's interpretation
  3. Synthesize narrative with LLM (GPT-5)
- Output: Comprehensive natal horoscope
  - Format: Plain language, moderate astrology terminology
  - Best practices: Use Brennan and Liz Greene methods
  - Include: Planetary strength table
  - No chart diagram needed
  - **Length**: To be researched during implementation
  - Save to `/reports/`
- Research during build: Tone, length, sections, depth

**Mode 2: Personalized Transit Report**
- Input: Area of life + timeframe (days)
- Process:
  1. Generate seed info (current transits, aspects to natal)
  2. Filter transits by area of life (map to houses)
  3. Query RAG for each relevant transit
  4. Synthesize targeted report with advice
- Output: Transit report scaled to important information
  - Save to `/reports/`
- **Design to be researched**: Format, prioritization, advice style

**Mode 3+: Traditional Timing Techniques** (CLI commands)
- Based on Stage 0 research (see findings above)
- **Core Techniques** (Must implement):
  1. Annual Profections - Time-lord activation (essential for transit filtering)
  2. Zodiacal Releasing - Major life chapter periods
  3. Secondary Progressions - Inner development timeline
- **Optional Techniques** (Post-MVP):
  4. Solar Returns - Annual forecast chart
  5. Planetary Returns - Jupiter/Saturn cycles
- Each technique becomes a CLI command
- All contribute context for Transit/Advice Chatbot

**Chat Mode A: Horoscope Inquirer**
- Rolling conversation about natal chart
- User asks: personality, ideal vocation, chart placements
- AI assesses question, retrieves relevant data, answers directly
- **Chat history length**: To be researched
- Session-aware (natal chart loaded)

**Chat Mode B: Transit/Advice Chatbot**
- Generate transit report first
- Then rolling conversation about report + current situation
- User asks: current transits, timing, advice for specific situations
- AI pulls from transit report + timing techniques + RAG database
- Gives advice based on traditional literature
- Session-aware (natal chart + transit report loaded)

**Future**: Combine both chat modes once they work independently

---

## Staged Implementation Plan

### Stage -1: RAG Database Enhancement
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Goal**: Process new reference and optimize database

   - Use astrology-rag-builder agent
   - Extract text from PDF
   - Create semantic chunks (200-800 tokens)
   - Generate embeddings
   - Add to RAG database
   - Tag with metadata (source, author, tradition, content_type)

2. **Assess All References for Redundancy**:
   - Current references:
     1. Hellenistic Astrology (Chris Brennan)
     2. Astrology and the Authentic Self (Demetra George)
     3. Planets in Transit (Robert Hand)
     4. Predictive Astrology (Bernadette Brady)
     5. Delineation of Progressions (Sophia Mason)

- Database optimized for performance
- Documentation updated

**Deliverables**:
- Updated RAG database (JSONL file)
- Redundancy assessment report
- Recommendations for which sources to keep/remove

---

### Stage 0: Research Timing Techniques ‚úÖ
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Status**: COMPLETE (2025-10-04)
**Goal**: Identify which traditional timing techniques to implement as CLI modes

**Research Findings**:

**MUST IMPLEMENT** (Core Mode 3+ Techniques):
1. **Annual Profections** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - ESSENTIAL
   - Time-lord activation system (1 house per year of life)
   - Required for Hephaestio's 7-factor transit analysis
   - Lord of year determines CRITICAL vs NORMAL tier transits
   - Well-documented: Brennan Ch. 17 (17 pages)
   - Complexity: LOW (~100 lines, no ephemeris needed)
   - Implement FIRST in Stage 1.4

2. **Zodiacal Releasing** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Major life chapter periods from Lot of Fortune/Spirit
   - Peak periods (angular triads) for opportunities
   - Well-documented: Brennan Ch. 18 (38 pages)
   - Complexity: MEDIUM-HIGH (~300 lines, ephemeris needed)
   - Implement SECOND in Stage 1.4

3. **Secondary Progressions** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Inner development timeline (1 day = 1 year)
   - Progressed Moon shows emotional focus
   - Well-documented: Entire Mason book, Brennan mentions
   - Complexity: MEDIUM (~200 lines, ephemeris needed)
   - Implement THIRD in Stage 1.4

**NICE-TO-HAVE** (Post-MVP Enhancements):
4. **Solar Returns** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Annual forecast chart
   - Documented: George Ch. 12
   - Complexity: MEDIUM (~200 lines)
   - Implement FOURTH or later

5. **Planetary Returns** ‚≠ê‚≠ê - Jupiter/Saturn major cycles
   - Limited specific coverage in RAG
   - Complexity: MEDIUM (~150 lines)
   - Implement FIFTH or skip for MVP

**NOT RECOMMENDED** (Redundant or Poorly Documented):
- ‚ùå Lunar phases/returns - Redundant with Mode 2 transits
- ‚ùå Firdaria - Poor RAG coverage (1 mention only)
- ‚ùå Primary directions - Extreme complexity, minimal RAG coverage

**Key Insight**: Annual profections is REQUIRED, not optional, because:
- Dorotheus/Anubio state only lord of year transits manifest as events
- Transit interpretation enhancement (design doc) requires it
- Foundation for entire transit priority system

**Deliverables**: ‚úÖ
- `/docs/timing_techniques_plan.md` created (comprehensive research)
- Priority implementation order defined
- Integration with Transit/Advice Chatbot designed
- CLI command structure planned
- This update to session_goals.md

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ
- Clear understanding of which techniques add value
- Implementation roadmap defined
- Ready to proceed to Stage 1

---

### Stage 1: Build CLI with All Modes
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Goal**: Working CLI interface for horoscope, transits, and all timing techniques
**Current Sub-Stage**: 1.3 - Natal Interpretation Enhancement Research (IN PROGRESS üîÑ)

**IMPORTANT**: All agent instructions (for horoscope generation, transit reports, chat responses) must be shown to user for approval before agents are created. Agent instructions serve as the "prompts" that control output quality and style.

**Sub-stages**:

#### 1.1: CLI Session System Foundation ‚úÖ
- Build `astrology_session.py` orchestrator (~200 lines)
  - Loads natal chart at session start
  - Maintains session state
  - Routes commands to mode handlers
  - Manages `/reports/` folder output
- **Status**: COMPLETE (natal-interpreter agent created and tested)

#### 1.2: Mode 1 - Natal Horoscope Generator
- **First**: Create natal-interpreter agent using agent-creator
  - Define agent role, tone, output style ‚Üí User approves agent instructions
  - Agent instructions control quality, citations, traditional compliance
- **Then**: Build `horoscope_generator.py` (~150-200 lines)
  - Script calculates positions and dignities
  - Script queries RAG for interpretations
  - Script calls natal-interpreter agent to synthesize
  - Script formats and saves report
- **Research during build**:
  - **Tone**: Plain language, moderate astrology terminology
  - **Best practices**: Use Brennan and Liz Greene methods from RAG database
  - **Length**: Research what makes a comprehensive horoscope (don't pre-specify)
  - **Sections**: Overview ‚Üí Planets (by strength) ‚Üí Aspects ‚Üí Synthesis?
  - **Format**:
    - Planetary strength table
    - No chart diagram
    - Citations from sources
  - **Output**: Save to `/reports/natal_horoscope_[name]_[date].md`
- **Testing phase**: Generate test horoscope, evaluate quality, refine agent instructions if needed
- **Status**: Pending (will proceed after Stage 1.3 research complete)

#### 1.3: Natal Interpretation Enhancement Research üîÑ
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Expand natal interpretation depth and thoroughness while protecting traditional foundation

**Enhancement Initiative Overview**:
This research phase explores 15 additional astrology methods (9 traditional + 6 modern) to increase horoscope depth and customization options.

**Settings Block System Design**:
- Replaces CLI input flags with file-based settings block
- Allows fine-grained control over interpretation depth and methods
- Lives in birth data file (`Darren_Profile.txt`)

**Settings Block Format**:
```
[SETTINGS]
interpretation_depth: standard|deep|comprehensive
include_house_rulers: true|false
include_lots: basic|extended|full
include_angles_aspects: true|false (toggle if birth time uncertain)
include_nodes: true|false
include_lilith: true|false (default: true, but toggleable)
include_chiron: true|false (default: true, but toggleable)
include_receptions: true|false
include_psychological: basic|deep
modern_methods: conservative|moderate|extensive
```

**Traditional Foundation Protection** (CRITICAL):
- All modern methods clearly labeled as supplementary
- Hierarchical interpretation: Traditional primary, modern secondary
- Modern additions never override traditional dignities or core methods
- Hellenistic/traditional foundation remains unchanged
- User can disable modern methods entirely via settings
- Traditional methods seamlessly integrate with existing foundation

**Topics Being Researched** (15 total):

**Traditional Methods** (fits current Hellenistic foundation):
1. House Rulers / Derivative Houses
2. Lots / Arabic Parts (extended system beyond Fortune/Spirit)
3. Angles as Chart Points (ASC/MC/DC/IC aspects)
4. Lunar Nodes (North/South Node meanings)
5. Receptions (Mutual, Mixed)
6. Bonification / Maltreatment (benefic/malefic helping/harming)
7. Triplicities (detailed elemental dignity analysis)
8. Egyptian Bounds (detailed bounds ruler analysis)
9. Antiscia (zodiacal reflection points)

**Modern Methods** (supplementary only, clearly labeled):
10. Lilith (Black Moon) - toggleable, default ON
11. Chiron (Wounded Healer) - toggleable, default ON
12. Psychological/Jungian depth (Liz Greene methods from RAG)
13. Harmonic/Minor Aspects (quintile, septile, etc.)
14. Midpoints (Ebertin method)
15. Vertex (fated encounters point)

**Implementation Phases**:
- **Phase 1**: Documentation update ‚úÖ (this update)
- **Phase 2**: RAG agent debug/fix (ensure query tool working)
- **Phase 3**: RAG database coverage scan (check coverage for all 15 topics)
- **Phase 4**: Ultrathink workflow & architecture design
- **Phase 5**: Create enhancement deliverables:
  - Design document (`/docs/natal_interpretation_enhancement.md`)
  - Implementation plan (staged rollout)
  - Settings parser specification
  - Agent instruction updates (if needed)

**Success Criteria**:

  - **Output**: Save to `/reports/transit_report_[name]_[date].md`
- **Testing phase**: Generate test reports, evaluate quality, refine agent instructions if needed
- **Status**: Pending

#### 1.5: Mode 3+ - Additional Timing Techniques
- Build CLI command for each technique identified in Stage 0
- Example: `zodiacal_releasing.py`, `profections.py`, `progressions.py`
- Each module (~100-200 lines):
  1. Calculate technique-specific data
  2. Query RAG for interpretations
  3. Format and generate report (may be simple formatting, may need agent synthesis)
  4. Save to `/reports/`
- **Agent decision**: Determine per technique if synthesis agent needed or simple formatting sufficient
- **Testing phase**: Test each technique, validate calculations, iterate if needed
- **Status**: Pending

---

### Stage 3: Build Two Separate Rolling Chats
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Goal**: Interactive conversation modes for natal chart and transits

**IMPORTANT**: All chat agent instructions and function calling configurations must be shown to user for approval before agents are created. These agents will handle interactive conversations about natal charts and transits.

**Why two separate chats?**
- Different contexts and purposes
- Easier to build and test independently
- Can combine later once both work

#### 3.1: Chat Mode A - Horoscope Inquirer
- Build `horoscope_chat.py` (~200 lines)
- **Purpose**: Rolling conversation about natal chart
- **User questions**:
  - "What does Mars in Aries in 9th house mean for me?"
  - "What's my ideal vocation based on my chart?"
  - "How do I work with Saturn in my 10th house?"
  - "What are my chart's dominant themes?"
- **Architecture**: OpenAI function calling + session state
- **Functions AI can call**:
  - `get_planet_analysis(planet)` - Get planet position, dignity, strength
  - `get_aspect_between(planet1, planet2)` - Calculate aspect
  - `query_rag(query_string)` - Search traditional texts
  - `get_house_topics(house_num)` - House significations
  - `calculate_dignity(planet, sign)` - Dignity status
- **Chat history**: To be researched - reasonable number of messages to keep?
- **Session state**: Natal chart stays loaded
- **Output**: Conversational, cites sources

#### 3.2: Chat Mode B - Transit/Advice Chatbot
- Build `transit_chat.py` (~200 lines)
- **Purpose**: Rolling conversation about current situation and transits
- **Workflow**:
  1. Generate transit report first (Mode 2)
  2. User can then ask questions about report + current situation
- **User questions**:
  - "What transits are affecting my career right now?"
  - "When will this difficult period end?"
  - "How should I approach this Saturn transit?"
  - "What opportunities are coming up in the next 3 months?"
- **Context available**:
  - Pre-generated transit report
  - All timing technique data (zodiacal releasing, profections, etc.)
  - Natal chart analysis
  - RAG database for traditional advice
- **Functions AI can call**:
  - `get_transit_details(planet, aspect, natal_planet)` - Detailed transit info
  - `get_timing_technique(technique_name)` - Zodiacal releasing, profections, etc.
  - `query_rag_advice(situation)` - Traditional advice for situations
  - `calculate_future_transits(planet, days)` - Upcoming transits
- **Chat history**: Research needed
- **Output**: Advice based on traditional literature, grounded in transits

#### 3.3: Integration
**CLI Interface with Chats**:
```bash
Commands:
  horoscope - Generate full natal horoscope
  transits <area> <days> - Transit report
  [timing techniques...]
  chat-horoscope - Start horoscope chat session
  chat-transits - Start transit chat session (generates report first)
  exit - End session

> chat-horoscope
Starting horoscope chat...
Ask me anything about your natal chart.

You: What does Mars in Aries mean for me?
AI: Mars in Aries in your 9th house represents Mars in its domicile...
[Conversation continues]

You: exit
Exiting horoscope chat.

> chat-transits
Generating current transit report...
Report saved to /reports/transit_report_2025-10-04.md
Starting transit chat...
Ask me about your current transits or situation.

You: What's happening with Saturn right now?
AI: Saturn is currently transiting...
[Conversation continues with context from report + timing techniques]
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Both chat modes working independently
- AI retrieves correct data via function calling
- Answers are accurate, well-cited, traditional
- Conversation flows naturally
- Can maintain context across multiple questions
- No hallucinations or made-up aspects

**Testing Phase**:

### Transit Report Design

**Research during Stage 1 build**:
- Format and structure
- Prioritization methodology
- How many transits to include
- Advice format (actionable vs. general)
- Timeframe presentation
- Citation style

### Chat Interface Design

**Research needed**:
1. **Function Calling**: Which functions should AI have access to?
   - Horoscope chat: planet analysis, aspects, dignities, RAG queries
   - Transit chat: transit details, timing techniques, advice, future transits
2. **Conversation Memory**: How many messages to retain?
   - Start with 10 messages?
   - Test and adjust
3. **Error Handling**: What if question is unanswerable from chart?
   - Graceful fallback: "I don't have enough information to answer that accurately. Can you rephrase?"

## Success Factors

### What Will Make This Succeed?

1. **Quality Output**: Interpretations must be accurate, well-cited, traditional
2. **Ease of Use**: Even non-technical users can generate reports
3. **Your Daily Use**: If you use it regularly, it's working
4. **Incremental Validation**: Test each stage before moving to next
5. **Traditional Compliance**: All interpretations grounded in sources
6. **Good Prompts**: Well-engineered prompts for GPT-5
7. **Comprehensive Timing**: Multiple techniques give fuller picture
8. **Separate Chat Modes**: Focused contexts prevent confusion

### What Could Derail This?

1. **Prompt Engineering**: If LLM output is poor quality, need to iterate
2. **RAG Coverage Gaps**: If database lacks key interpretations, need to expand
3. **Over-Engineering**: Building complex features before validating basics
4. **Scope Creep**: Adding features instead of perfecting core modes
5. **Settings Issues**: Wrong GPT-5 settings could degrade output

**Mitigation**:
- Start simple (Stage -1, 0, 1)
- Validate quality at each stage
- Research before building
- Test with your own chart continuously
- Expand only when ready

## Non-Goals (What We're NOT Doing)

1. **Not building for scale initially**: Focus on single-user (you) first
2. **Not building a business/marketplace**: Just a tool for your use
3. **Not adding modern astrology**: Strict traditional/Hellenistic only
4. **Not building chart calculation from scratch**: Use Swiss Ephemeris
5. **Not building mobile apps**: Web/Telegram sufficient for mobile access
6. **Not adding social features**: No sharing, comments, or community (yet)
7. **Not monetizing initially**: Focus on quality and personal use
8. **Not using Claude API yet**: That's a speculative future update

## Current Status

**Stage**: Stage 1 implementation (Sub-stage 1.3 IN PROGRESS üîÑ)
**Completed Stages**: Stage -1 ‚úÖ, Stage 0 ‚úÖ, Stage 1.1 ‚úÖ
**Current Work**: Stage 1.3 - Natal Interpretation Enhancement Research
**Next Action**: Debug RAG agent, scan database coverage for 15 enhancement topics
**Recent Infrastructure Improvements** (2025-10-04):
- Strengthened documentation automation system
- Added proactive triggers to docs-updater-astrology agent ‚úÖ
- Added proactive triggers to astrology-rag-builder agent ‚úÖ
- Created agent-creator meta-agent ‚úÖ
  - Helps user create new custom agents conversationally (instead of /agents command)
  - Gathers requirements, drafts definitions, iterates, ensures quality
  - Automatically triggers docs-updater-astrology after creating agents
  - File: `.claude/agents/agent-creator.md`
  - Makes agent creation collaborative and template-matched
- All docs now update automatically after major steps
- All critical agents now trigger automatically (no manual prompts needed)
- Clear division of labor between workflow-planner-2 and docs-updater-astrology
- This ensures session_goals.md, CLAUDE.md, and agent READMEs stay synchronized

## Questions for Workflow Planner (Ongoing)

As we build, consult workflow-planner-2 agent for:
- Architecture decisions
- Framework/library recommendations
- Prompt engineering strategies
- Error handling patterns
- Testing approaches
- Deployment options
- GPT-5 settings optimization

---

## Documentation Strategy

- **This file (session_goals.md)**: High-level vision, strategic direction, simple
- **/docs/**: Detailed design docs (horoscope_design.md, timing_techniques_plan.md, chat_design.md, etc.)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Current state, completed work, system catalog
- **/reports/**: All generated horoscopes, transit reports, timing analyses

**Ownership**:
- **workflow-planner-2**: Creates session_goals.md structure, defines stages, makes recommendations (does NOT mark progress)
- **docs-updater-astrology**: Marks progress in session_goals.md, updates CLAUDE.md, maintains current state (does NOT change plan)
- **Implementation agents**: Document detailed specs in /docs/

**Automatic Updates**: After every major step, docs-updater-astrology automatically updates all three documentation types (session_goals.md progress + CLAUDE.md + READMEs). No manual prompts needed.
