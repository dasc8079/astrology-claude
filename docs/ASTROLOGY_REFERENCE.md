## Foundation

**Tradition**: Hellenistic astrology with modern psychological integration
- Traditional/Hellenistic methods form the foundation
- Modern planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) add psychological context
- Modern techniques applied ONLY where they enhance traditional base

## Planetary Bodies

### Traditional Seven Planets (PRIMARY)

**Personal Expression** - Change signs frequently, represent individual experience:
- ☉ **Sun** - Vitality, identity, conscious will (sect light in day charts)
- ☽ **Moon** - Emotions, nurturing, inner life (sect light in night charts)
- ☿ **Mercury** - Communication, thought, learning
- ♀ **Venus** - Love, beauty, values, pleasure (benefic of sect in night charts)
- ♂ **Mars** - Action, desire, assertion (malefic contrary to sect in day charts)
- ♃ **Jupiter** - Expansion, wisdom, growth (benefic of sect in day charts)
- ♄ **Saturn** - Structure, limitation, mastery (malefic contrary to sect in night charts)

### Outer Planets (SECONDARY - Generational Context)

**Collective Consciousness** - Spend years/decades in signs, represent generational themes:
- ♅ **Uranus** - Revolution, innovation, liberation (7 years/sign)
- ♆ **Neptune** - Dissolution, spirituality, imagination (14 years/sign)
- ♇ **Pluto** - Transformation, power, depth (12-30 years/sign)

**Usage**: Add psychological depth and generational context. NOT used as sign rulers. Elevated to PRIMARY when <1° conjunct PRIMARY factors or angular + well-aspected.

### Additional Bodies (TERTIARY - Conditional)

- ⚷ **Chiron** - Wound/healing archetype (enabled per profile settings)
- ⚸ **Lilith** (Black Moon) - Shadow feminine archetype (enabled per profile settings)

**Usage**: Only calculated if enabled in profile.md. Elevated to PRIMARY when <1° conjunct PRIMARY factors (especially sect light or angular planets).

- House cusps at 0° of each sign
- Ascendant sign = 1st house
- Simple, traditional, effective for timing techniques

**Why Whole-Sign?**
- Traditional Hellenistic standard
- Works seamlessly with zodiacal releasing, profections, annual profections
- Clear house boundaries (no intercepted signs)
- House ruler analysis straightforward

---

## Essential Dignities

**Domicile** (Rulership) - Strongest:
- Planet in sign it rules (e.g., Mars in Aries, Venus in Taurus)

**Exaltation** - Empowered:
- Sun in Aries, Moon in Taurus, Mercury in Virgo, Venus in Pisces, Mars in Capricorn, Jupiter in Cancer, Saturn in Libra

**Triplicity** (Elemental Dignity) - Moderate:
- Fire: Sun (day), Jupiter (night), Saturn (participating)
- Earth: Venus (day), Moon (night), Mars (participating)

**See**: [ASTROLOGY_EXCLUSIONS.md](ASTROLOGY_EXCLUSIONS.md) for life-area lots not used in natal interpretation.

## Nodes

**North Node** ☊ - Point of increase
- Amplifies planets it aspects
- Where eclipses occur (with South Node)
- Represents growth direction (modern interpretation)

**South Node** ☋ - Point of decrease
- Diminishes planets it aspects
- Release point, letting go
- Represents past patterns (modern interpretation)

**Traditional View**: Points of danger/instability due to eclipse association. NOT karmic (modern addition).

**Usage**: TERTIARY modifiers. Elevated to SECONDARY when <3° conjunct planet.

---

## Angles

**Four Critical Points**:

1. **Ascendant** (ASC) - Rising sign
   - Identity, appearance, how others experience you
   - ASC sign: PRIMARY factor
   - Chart ruler (ASC ruler): ALWAYS PRIMARY

2. **Midheaven** (MC) - 10th house cusp
   - Public role, career, reputation
   - MC sign: PRIMARY factor
   - MC ruler: ALWAYS PRIMARY

3. **Descendant** (DSC) - 7th house cusp
   - Partnerships, marriage, relationships
   - DSC sign: SECONDARY factor
   - DSC ruler: SECONDARY minimum

4. **Imum Coeli** (IC) - 4th house cusp
   - Roots, foundation, family, private self
   - IC sign: SECONDARY factor
   - IC ruler: SECONDARY minimum

**Planets conjunct angles** (<3° orb): Elevated in importance (see hierarchical_weighting_specification.md)

---

## Antiscia

**Mirror degrees** across the Cancer-Capricorn axis:
- Hidden connections via symmetry
- Most useful in timing work (transits, progressions)

**Usage**: TERTIARY factor. Mention only when <3° to planet/angle.

---

## Fixed Stars

**5 Major Stars** tracked:
1. **Spica** (♍ ~23°) - Benefic: Gifts, protection, success through skill
2. **Regulus** (♌ ~29°) - Royal: Leadership, prominence, courage
3. **Algol** (♉ ~26°) - Malefic: Intensity, transformation challenges
4. **Antares** (♐ ~9°) - Intense: Crisis, breakthrough, passion
5. **Fomalhaut** (♓ ~3°) - Mystical: Spirituality, idealism, vision

**Usage**: TERTIARY factor. Mention only when <1° conjunct planet/angle.

**Why only 5?** Prevents clutter. These are the most consistently impactful in interpretation.

## Timing Techniques (Predictive Methods)

### Annual Profections
- Each year activates a house (age 0 = 1st house, age 1 = 2nd house, etc.)
- 12-year cycle repeats
- Time lord = ruler of activated house

### Zodiacal Releasing (ZR)
- **L1 periods**: 8-30 year chapters (major life periods)
- **L2 periods**: 1-3 year sub-chapters
- **L3 periods**: 2-10 month themes
- Based on Lot of Fortune (body/life events) or Lot of Spirit (career/purpose)

### Secondary Progressions
- Day-for-a-year symbolism
- Progressed Moon ~1° per month (emotional cycles)
- Progressed Sun ~1° per year (life development)

### Solar Returns
- Chart for moment Sun returns to natal position each year
- Annual themes and forecast

### Firdaria
- Persian system of planetary periods
- Each planet rules a set period of years
- Useful for life arc timing

- **Stationary** - Nearly motionless (intensified)

**Aspect Dynamics**:
- **Overcoming** - Planet in earlier sign aspects planet in later sign (dominates)
- **Enclosure** - Planet between two others (contained, modified)

## Hierarchical Weighting

**See**: [hierarchical_weighting_specification.md](hierarchical_weighting_specification.md) for complete details on PRIMARY/SECONDARY/TERTIARY factor classification.

**Quick Summary**:
- Traditional planets: Weighted by dignity + angularity
- Outer planets: SECONDARY (generational context)
- Chiron/Lilith: TERTIARY (elevated when conjunct PRIMARY factors)
- Lots: PRIMARY when in key houses
- Nodes: TERTIARY modifiers
- Angles: PRIMARY factors

---

## Key Principles

1. **Traditional foundation** - Hellenistic methods are the base
2. **Modern integration** - Psychological depth without abandoning tradition
3. **Hierarchical interpretation** - Not all factors are equal (PRIMARY > SECONDARY > TERTIARY)
4. **Sect awareness** - Day/night distinction colors all interpretations
5. **House ruler focus** - WHERE ruler goes tells the story
6. **Essential + accidental dignity** - Planetary strength comes from both
