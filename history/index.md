## Completed Stages

### [Stage -1: RAG Database Enhancement](STAGE_-1_RAG_Enhancement.md)
**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Duration**: 1 day
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Summary**: Enhanced the RAG database foundation to support application development. Added "The Horoscope in Manifestation" (Liz Greene) as 6th reference source, bringing total to 2,472 semantic chunks. Created session_goals.md with North Star vision. Assessed literature redundancy and confirmed all 6 sources provide unique value.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Database ready with 2,472 chunks across 6 authoritative sources
- North Star vision established in session_goals.md
- All sources validated as unique and valuable
- Output directory structure created

**Files**:
- RAG database: `/output/database/astrology_rag_database.jsonl`
- Session goals: `/docs/session_goals.md`
- Literature assessment: `/output/literature_redundancy_assessment.md`

### [Stage 0: Research Timing Techniques](STAGE_0_Research_Timing.md)
**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Duration**: 1 day
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Summary**: Comprehensive research into traditional timing techniques using RAG database. Identified 3 core techniques for implementation: Annual Profections, Zodiacal Releasing, and Secondary Progressions. Made critical discovery that profections are REQUIRED for transit filtering and prioritization.

**Key Outcomes**:
- 3 core timing techniques identified (profections, ZR, progressions)
- Critical integration discovered: profections required for transit priority
- 25+ page implementation plan created
- Session goals updated with findings

**Impact on Future Work**:
- Mode 3 (Transits) must include profections to prioritize transits
- Mode 4 (Additional Timing) will add ZR, progressions, returns

**Files**:
- Timing plan: `/docs/timing_techniques_plan.md`
- Updated session goals: `/docs/session_goals.md`

### [Stage 1: Natal Horoscope System](STAGE_1_Natal_Horoscope.md)
**Date**: 2025-10-04 to 2025-10-05
**Duration**: 2 days
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Summary**: Built complete natal horoscope generation system with multi-profile support, automated workflow, and PDF output. Established foundation for all future astrological analysis modes. Created natal-interpreter agent and automated end-to-end horoscope generation.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Working system: Generate natal horoscopes with one command
- Multi-profile support with isolated user data
- Professional output: Markdown + PDF with beautiful formatting
- Automated workflow: No manual steps, no verification needed
- Reusable patterns: Profile loader, settings parser, agent invocation

**Key Files Created**:
- `/scripts/create_profile.py` - Profile creation automation
- `/scripts/create_synthesis_pdf.py` - PDF generation
- `/scripts/profile_loader.py` - Multi-profile utilities
- `/scripts/settings_parser.py` - Profile settings handling
- `.claude/agents/natal-interpreter.md` - Synthesis agent

**Profiles Created**:
- `darren/` - Complete (technical + synthesis)
- `mom/` - Synthesis only
- `sister/` - Synthesis only

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Agent modification policy: Synthesis agents need user approval before changes
2. Narrative style preferred: Flowing prose, not bullet points
3. House rulers critical: Must be integrated throughout, not just mentioned
4. Settings self-documentation: Inline comments make settings discoverable
5. PDF extraction flexibility: Handle multiple markdown formats gracefully

**Next Stage**: Stage 2 - Life Arc Report System (moved ahead of transits)

### [Stage 2: Life Arc Report System](STAGE_2_Life_Arc_Report.md)
**Date**: 2025-10-05 to 2025-10-07
**Duration**: 3 days
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Summary**: Built comprehensive life arc report system generating decades-long life timelines (ages 0-100) with convergence detection and narrative interpretation. Integrated 5 core timing techniques, built Firdaria calculator, implemented point-based convergence scoring, and created chapter-based narrative structure using ZR L1 periods.

**Key Outcomes**:
- 5 core timing techniques integrated: Profections, ZR Fortune/Spirit L1, Firdaria, Planetary Returns, Progressed Sun
- Convergence detection system: Point-based scoring (25+ MAJOR, 15-24 SIGNIFICANT, 8-14 NOTABLE)
- Narrative chapter structure: ZR L1 periods as chapters, convergences as subheadings
- 10 lots integrated: Added Exaltation, Marriage, Children formulas
- Complete workflow: Calculator + simplified interpreter + full RAG-integrated agent
- Professional output: Markdown + PDF (157.9 KB typical)

**Key Files Created**:
- `/scripts/firdaria_calculator.py` - Persian time-lord system (329 lines)
- `/scripts/test_convergence.py` - Convergence detection test script (141 lines)
- `/docs/firdaria_reference.md` - Traditional sources (20KB)

**Enhanced Files**:
- `/scripts/life_arc_generator.py` - Added Firdaria, returns, progressions, convergence (287 lines added)
- `/scripts/seed_data_generator.py` - Added 3 new lot calculations (61 lines added)
- `/.claude/agents/life-arc-interpreter.md` - Complete rewrite for narrative structure (399 lines)

**Testing**:
- Full 0-100 report generated for darren profile
- 6 major events, 11 significant transitions, 7 notable periods identified
- PDF generation working (157.9 KB output)
- Output directory structure corrected to `profiles/{profile}/output/`

**Lessons Learned**:
1. Convergence scoring: Point-based system effectively identifies major events without noise
2. Narrative structure: Chapter-based organization (ZR L1 periods) creates natural flow
3. ZR L2 noise: Skip L2 sub-periods for clarity (8-30 year L1 periods provide better structure)
4. Profile settings: Single-line format easier to scan and modify
5. Output directory: Correct path `profiles/{profile}/output/` (not root `/output/`)

**Next Stage**: Stage 3 - Transit Report System (design documents complete, ready to implement)

## Stage Naming Convention

- **Stage -1, 0**: Foundation and research phases
- **Stage 1+**: Core feature implementation phases

## Archival Process

When a stage is complete:

1. Document all work completed, files created, lessons learned
2. Create `/history/STAGE_N_Name.md` with full details
3. Update CURRENT_WORK.md to remove completed stage
4. Update this index with summary and key outcomes
5. Move on to next stage

## Archives

### [CLAUDE.md Archive - 2025-10-06](CLAUDE_ARCHIVE_2025_10_06.md)
**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Type**: Documentation Archive
**Status**: Archived for reference

**Summary**: Full archive of CLAUDE.md before transitioning to global Claude Code framework structure. Original file was 89KB (2,705 lines) with extensive technical details that have been moved to appropriate documentation locations.

**Content Relocated**:
- Swiss Ephemeris Integration → `/docs/` or DEVELOPMENT.md
- Static Astrology Reference Data → REFERENCE.md
- RAG Database sections → `/docs/` or archived
- Development Guidelines → DEVELOPMENT.md
- Glossary → REFERENCE.md
- Detailed stage history → Kept in /history/STAGE_*.md files

**New Structure**: CLAUDE.md is now a navigation hub (~10KB) pointing to CURRENT_WORK.md, session_goals.md, /docs/, and /history/
