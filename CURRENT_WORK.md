## 🎯 Recent Milestones (2025-10-07)

### Mode 2: Life Arc Report Generator - COMPLETE ✅ (Enhanced)

**Major Achievement**: Full Mode 2 enhancement complete with narrative story structure and convergence detection

**Enhancement Summary** (12 tasks completed):
1. ✅ **Profile Settings Simplified**: Single-line `variable: true|false // description` format for easier scanning
2. ✅ **10 Lots Integrated**: All calculated lots (Fortune, Spirit, Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory, Basis, Exaltation, Marriage, Children) now accessible in timeline
3. ✅ **3 New Lots Added**: Exaltation, Marriage, Children formulas added to seed_data_generator.py
4. ✅ **Firdaria Calculator Built**: Complete 75-year Persian time-lord system (major + sub-periods, sect-based)
5. ✅ **Planetary Returns Added**: Jupiter (~12y), Saturn (~29.5y), Uranus opposition (~42y) milestone markers
6. ✅ **Progressed Sun Changes Added**: Rare identity evolution events every ~30 years
7. ✅ **Convergence Detection Implemented**: Point-based scoring system (MAJOR 25+pts, SIGNIFICANT 15-24pts, NOTABLE 8-14pts)
8. ✅ **Narrative Chapter Structure**: ZR L1 periods = chapters, convergences = subheadings, "Current Situation" sub-chapter
9. ✅ **life-arc-interpreter Agent Updated**: Complete rewrite for storytelling approach (ages 0-100 equally weighted)
10. ✅ **Title Page Formatted**: "Life Arc Report 0-100" + name + birth data + date created
11. ✅ **Full System Tested**: Complete 0-100 report generated for darren profile (6 chapters, 6 major events, 11 significant transitions)
12. ✅ **Output Directory Fixed**: All files now go to `profiles/{profile}/output/` (not root `/output/`)

**Core Timeline Techniques** (5 primary + 2 optional):
- ✅ Annual Profections (12-year cycles)
- ✅ Zodiacal Releasing Fortune L1 (8-30 year chapters, skip L2 for noise reduction)
- ✅ Zodiacal Releasing Spirit L1 (8-30 year chapters, skip L2)
- ✅ Firdaria (75-year planetary period cycle, major + sub-periods)
- ✅ Planetary Returns (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus opposition)
- ✅ Progressed Sun Sign Changes (every ~30 years)
- ⚪ Secondary Progressions (optional, calculated but not emphasized)
- ⚪ Solar Returns (optional, calculated but not emphasized)

**What Works Now**:
- ✅ **Calculator**: life_arc_generator.py (unified timeline with all techniques)
- ✅ **Convergence Detection**: Automatic flagging of major life events (25+ points)
- ✅ **Simplified Interpreter**: life_arc_synthesis_simplified.py (~3K word syntheses, no RAG)
- ✅ **Full Interpreter**: life-arc-interpreter agent (RAG-integrated narrative synthesis)
- ✅ **Narrative Structure**: Chapter-based storytelling (not technique-by-technique analysis)
- ✅ **PDF Generation**: Working
- ✅ **Complete Workflow**: Full pipeline from data generation to narrative interpretation

**Current Reality**:
1. ✅ life_arc_generator.py enhanced (5 core techniques + convergence detection)
2. ✅ firdaria_calculator.py created (Persian time-lord system)
3. ✅ Profile settings simplified (single-line format)
4. ✅ 10 lots integrated into timeline
5. ✅ Convergence scoring working (6 major, 11 significant, 7 notable events in 100-year lifespan)
6. ✅ life-arc-interpreter agent updated for narrative story structure
7. ✅ Full interpretation generated: `/profiles/darren/output/life_arc_interpretation_darren_ages_0-100.md`
8. ✅ PDF output working (157.9 KB)
9. ✅ Output directory structure corrected for future use

**Stage 4 COMPLETE + ENHANCED**:
- ✅ Unified timeline combining all timing techniques
- ✅ life_arc_generator.py enhanced with Firdaria, returns, progressions
- ✅ Convergence detection algorithm implemented
- ✅ life-arc-interpreter agent rewritten for narrative storytelling
- ✅ Chapter structure (ZR L1 periods)

- **RAG database** for traditional interpretations
- **Hybrid approach**: Chat queries both sources
- **Unified generator**: Expands with each mode (natal → life arc → transits)

**Documentation Structure** (NEW):
- `CURRENT_WORK.md` - This file (what's happening NOW)
- `REFERENCE.md` - Static astrology knowledge
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - How to contribute
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `/history/` - Archived completed stages

## 🤖 Agent Coordination

**Project-Specific Agents**:
- `docs-updater-astrology` - Updates this file + project docs
- `workflow-planner-2` - Maintains session_goals.md, technical recommendations
- `mode-orchestrator` - Routes requests to natal/life arc/transit modes (NEW)
- `natal-interpreter` - Generates natal horoscope synthesis (Mode 1) ✅ WORKING
- `life-arc-interpreter` - Generates whole-life arc interpretation (Mode 2) ✅ WORKING (fixed 2025-10-07)
- `astrology-rag-builder` - Maintains RAG database

**Global Agents** (from `~/.claude/agents/`):
- `history-manager` - Archives completed stages to `/history/`
- `agent-creator` - Creates new agents with correct frontmatter format ✅ ENHANCED (2025-10-07)

**Agent Status Notes**:
- life-arc-interpreter agent frontmatter corrected (removed broken YAML `description: |` syntax)
- agent-creator enhanced with "CRITICAL: Agent File Frontmatter Format" section
- All project agents now using correct frontmatter format

---

## 💡 Remember

- **Synthesis agents** (natal-interpreter, life-arc-interpreter) require user approval before modification
- **Narrative style preferred**: Flowing prose, not bullet points
- **House rulers critical**: Integrate naturally throughout interpretations
- **Traditional foundation protected**: Modern methods clearly labeled, always secondary
