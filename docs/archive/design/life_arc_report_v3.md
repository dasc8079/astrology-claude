# Life Arc V3 Significance System Specification

**Version**: 3.1
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Updated**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Period Clustering Implemented
**Author**: Collaborative design session (User + Claude)

---

## Implementation Status (2025-10-16)

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **15 Lots System** (Phase 0 - COMPLETE):
   - ‚úÖ Added 5 new relational lots to seed_data_generator.py (Father, Mother, Siblings, Accusation, Friends)
   - ‚úÖ Implemented Lot of Saturn dual interpretation (Basis/Nemesis based on dignities)
   - ‚úÖ Updated ASTROLOGY_REFERENCE.md with complete lot documentation
   - ‚úÖ Regenerated seed data for Darren_S and Sam_P profiles
   - ‚úÖ Verified all 15 lots calculate correctly

2. **Period-Based Clustering System** (NEW - COMPLETE):
   - ‚úÖ Implemented `identify_period_clusters()` - Groups consecutive elevated-activity ages into multi-year periods
   - ‚úÖ Implemented `analyze_period_nature()` - Classifies periods as challenging/transformative/favorable/mixed
   - ‚úÖ Integrated into `generate_life_arc_timeline()` with comprehensive statistics
   - ‚úÖ Gap tolerance (2 years) handles extended experiences like Saturn returns
   - ‚úÖ Peak detection within each period
   - ‚úÖ Tested with real data (Darren_S: 5 periods, Sam_P: 5 periods)

### ‚è≥ Pending Features

1. **Adaptive Thresholds** (Phase 3 - DEFERRED):
   - ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTING** - Testing showed fixed thresholds work well across profiles
   - **Reason**: Fixed thresholds (25/15/8) produce consistent ~26-30 events across all profiles tested
   - **Data Analysis (2025-10-16)**: Tested 3 profiles (Darren_S, Sam_P, Jamie_S)
     - All had similar score distributions (mean ~7, median 1-3, std dev ~9.5)
     - Adaptive thresholds would create too much noise (Darren: 47 events vs 26 with fixed)
     - Period clustering already provides chapter structure without needing adaptive scaling
   - **Note**: Only tested with 3 profiles - may revisit if more diverse profiles show need
   - **Alternative Achieved**: Period-based clustering system provides adaptive chapter structure

2. **Timing Point Activations** (Phase 3 - COMPLETE):
   - ‚úÖ Antiscia activation detection (+2 points) - Implemented and tested
   - ‚úÖ Fixed star activation detection (+3 points) - Implemented and tested
   - ‚úÖ Stellium activation detection (+5 points) - Implemented and tested
   - **Testing Results (2025-10-16)**:
     - Tested with Darren_S profile (ages 0-46)
     - Stellium activations: Detected at ages 5, 17, 29, 41 (House 6 stellium)
     - Antiscia activations: Detected throughout timeline (appropriate frequency)
     - Fixed star activations: Working correctly (none for Darren - no natal conjunctions)

3. **Traditional Overlays** (Phase 1 & 2 - NOT STARTED):
   - ‚è≥ Saturn Return contextual assessment
   - ‚è≥ Loosing of Bond detection
   - ‚è≥ Peak Period detection
   - ‚è≥ Profection house overlays (11H, 5H, 10H bonuses)

4. **V3 Agent Creation** (Phase 4 - NOT STARTED):
   - ‚è≥ Create life-arc-interpreter-v3.md agent
   - ‚è≥ Generate test reports
   - ‚è≥ Create V2‚ÜíV3 comparison document

### üéØ Current Focus

Implementing timing point activations (antiscia, fixed stars, stelliums) to add convergence scoring when profections/ZR periods activate these natal features. This will add 2-5 points when profections hit significant natal timing points.

## Overview

### What's New in V3.1 (2025-10-15)

**Major Enhancements**:
1. **Expanded Lots System**: Added 5 new traditional lots (Father, Mother, Siblings, Accusation, Friends) - **15 total lots**
2. **Lot of Saturn Dual Interpretation**: Same formula interpreted as "Basis" (when Saturn dignified) or "Nemesis" (when Saturn debilitated)
3. **Data-Driven Threshold System**: Replaced arbitrary thresholds with percentile-based adaptive scaling
4. **Timing Point Activations**: Added antiscia, fixed stars, and stelliums as convergence scoring factors
5. **V2/V3 Coexistence**: Both life-arc-interpreter-v2 and life-arc-interpreter-v3 agents remain operational

**Philosophy Shift**: Reports now scale with profile eventfulness - more eventful lives generate longer reports, quieter lives generate shorter reports. Thresholds determined from actual data distribution, not arbitrary numbers.

---

### Problem Statement

The current Life Arc significance detection system (V1/V2) fails to capture multi-year difficult periods that are experientially significant to users. Specifically:

1. **Saturn Return Aftermath Missed**: Ages 29-35 was user's most difficult life period, but only age 29 scored as SIGNIFICANT (15pts). The 3-5 year rebuilding period scored below threshold (8-13pts), creating no narrative coverage despite being extremely difficult.

2. **Traditional Periods Ignored**: Traditional Hellenistic concepts like "Loosing of the Bond" (final years before major L1 transitions) and "Peak Periods" (bonification when L2 matches L1) are not scored, despite being traditionally significant.

3. **Noise from Granular Periods**: V2 attempted to reduce noise by removing L2/Firdaria subs from convergence, but this was too aggressive - it removed meaningful patterns along with noise.

4. **Good Periods Underweighted**: System emphasizes difficult periods but doesn't equivalently highlight traditionally fortunate periods (11H profection years, peak periods, benefic-ruled years).

### Goals

1. **Capture Multi-Year Difficult Periods**: Saturn Returns should score the return moment AND assess whether the aftermath period needs extended coverage (ages 29-35 style).

2. **Integrate Traditional Significance**: Loosing of the Bond, Peak Periods, and other traditional Hellenistic concepts should receive scoring bonuses regardless of mechanical convergence.

3. **Balance Good and Bad**: Highlight traditionally fortunate periods (peak periods, 11H years, benefic activations) with equal weight to difficult periods.

4. **Maintain Clarity**: ~15 major events across 100 years (not 40+), organized around chapter-level transitions.

5. **Contextual Assessment**: Saturn Return difficulty should be assessed based on natal chart (6H/8H/12H placement, malefic of sect, afflictions) to determine whether 1-2 year or 3-5 year coverage is appropriate.

### Non-Goals

- Daily transit timing precision
- Complete algorithm redesign (keep convergence foundation)
- Predictive event forecasting
- Removing L2 data entirely (V2 mistake - keep data, just score selectively)

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **System MUST assess Saturn Return contextually**:
   - Check natal Saturn: house placement (6/8/12 = difficult), sect (malefic contrary = difficult), dignity (detriment/fall = challenged), aspects (afflicted = difficult)
   - IF 2+ difficulty indicators: Score return year 15pts, add +8pts/year for next 3-5 years "rebuilding period"
   - IF Saturn well-placed: Score return year 15pts, add +3pts/year for next 1-2 years only

2. **System MUST detect Loosing of the Bond**:
   - Identify final L2 period before each L1 transition
   - Add +10pts to ages within that final L2 period
   - Traditional significance: preparatory/intense phase before major chapter shift

3. **System MUST detect Peak Periods (bonification)**:
   - When ZR Fortune L2 matches L1 sign (e.g., Capricorn L2 within Capricorn L1)
   - Add +10pts to ages within that peak period
   - Traditional significance: empowered phase, smooth expression of chapter themes

4. **System MUST highlight good periods**:
   - 11H profection years: +3pts (traditionally fortunate - friends, hopes, benefactors)
   - 5H profection years: +2pts (creativity, pleasure, joy)
   - Benefic-ruled profection years (Jupiter/Venus): +2pts
   - Peak periods: +10pts (see #3 above)

5. **System MUST maintain L2 data** but score selectively:
   - Keep L2 periods in timeline data structure
   - Only score L2 transitions that are traditionally significant (peak, loosing, climax)
   - Regular L2 transitions score 0pts

6. **System SHOULD detect other traditional periods**:
   - Climax/culmination: Midpoint of L1 period ‚Üí +5pts
   - Opening phase: First 2 years of new L1 ‚Üí +5pts

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Scoring calculation should complete in <1 second per 100-year timeline
- **Backward Compatibility**: V1/V2 agents should continue working (don't break existing function signatures)
- **Testing**: All changes must be validated against Darren's profile ages 29-39 to confirm ages 29-35 period is captured

### Edge Cases

1. **Well-placed Saturn Returns**: User with Saturn exalted in Libra in 10H (day chart, benefic of sect) ‚Üí Brief coverage (1-2 years), not extended
2. **Multiple malefic indicators**: Saturn in Cancer in 12H, malefic contrary to sect, square Mars ‚Üí Maximum difficulty, 5-year aftermath coverage
3. **Peak periods during difficult chapters**: Capricorn Peak Period (L2=L1) during ages 12-15 within overall difficult Capricorn chapter ‚Üí Both +10pts for peak AND context of challenging chapter
4. **Loosing of Bond + Saturn Return convergence**: Age 37-39 has both Loosing of Bond (+10) AND approaches major L1 shift (+15) ‚Üí Scores stack appropriately
5. **Jupiter Return during Peak Period**: Age 12 has both Jupiter Return (+8) and Peak Period (+10) ‚Üí Correctly highlights fortunate transition
6. **11H profection year + Peak Period**: Age where both occur ‚Üí Bonuses stack (+3 + +10 = +13), creates NOTABLE event

## Lots System (V3.1 Enhancement)

### Overview

V3.1 expands the lots system from 10 to **15 traditional lots**, adding valuable timing data for relational, parental, social, and legal themes across the life arc.

### Included Lots (15 Total)

**Core Tier** (4 lots):
1. **Lot of Fortune** (‚äó) - Material resources, body, health, fortune
2. **Lot of Spirit** (‚äô) - Character, soul, life purpose, vocation
3. **Lot of Eros** (‚ô°) - Desires, love, passionate attachment
4. **Lot of Necessity** (‚öô) - Fate, constraint, compulsion

**Planetary Tier** (3 lots):
5. **Lot of Courage** (‚öî) - Bravery, assertion, martial activity
6. **Lot of Victory** (üèÜ) - Success, expansion, recognition, triumph
7. **Lot of Saturn (Basis/Nemesis)** (‚öì) - Foundation/structure OR retribution/enemies (see dual interpretation below)

**Relational/Life Domain Tier** (8 lots):
8. **Lot of Marriage** (üíç) - Partnership, committed relationships
9. **Lot of Children** (üë∂) - Offspring, generativity, legacy
10. **Lot of Father** (üë®) - Paternal relationships, authority figures, inheritance from father
11. **Lot of Mother** (üë©) - Maternal relationships, nurturing, emotional foundation
12. **Lot of Siblings** (üë•) - Peer relationships, siblings, equals, collaborators
13. **Lot of Accusation** (‚öñÔ∏è) - Legal issues, conflicts, accusations, disputes
14. **Lot of Friends** (ü§ù) - Social networks, beneficial connections, community
15. **Lot of Exaltation** (üëë) - Career peak, honors, public recognition

### Lot of Saturn: Dual Interpretation

**Same Formula, Context-Dependent Interpretation**:
- **Formula**: ASC + Fortune - Saturn (day), ASC + Saturn - Fortune (night)
- **When Saturn is dignified** (domicile, exaltation, strong triplicity):
  - Interpreted as **"Lot of Basis"**
  - Themes: Foundation, structure, stability, long-term building, endurance
  - Life arc timing: Constructive periods, building phases, establishing foundations
- **When Saturn is debilitated** (detriment, fall, peregrine, afflicted):
  - Interpreted as **"Lot of Nemesis"**
  - Themes: Retribution, enemies, downfall, consequences, karmic debt
  - Life arc timing: Challenge periods, confronting consequences, facing opposition

**Implementation**:
- Calculate lot once per profile
- Check natal Saturn dignities
- Flag primary interpretation in seed data
- Life arc interpreter uses appropriate lens based on Saturn's natal condition

### Excluded Lots (With Reasoning)

**Lot of Exaltation** (ASC + Mars - Sun):
- ‚ùå **EXCLUDED** - Formula doesn't match traditional Hellenistic sources
- Possibly modern invention or miscalculation
- Cannot verify authenticity
- **Alternative**: Kept in implementation but marked for review/verification

**Lot of Commerce** (ASC + Fortune - Spirit):
- ‚ùå **EXCLUDED** - Cannot verify this is traditional Hellenistic
- Possibly Renaissance or modern invention
- Insufficient source documentation
- **Replacement**: Lot of Friends serves similar social/network timing function

### Lots as Life Arc Timing Points

**Lots Activation Detection**:
When profections or ZR periods activate a lot (conjunction within 3¬∞), add convergence points:

```python
LOT_ACTIVATION_POINTS = {
    'fortune': 3,    # Core lot activation
    'spirit': 3,     # Core lot activation
    'relational': 2, # Marriage, Father, Mother, Siblings, Friends
    'domain': 2,     # Victory, Courage, Accusation, Children
}
```

**Example**: "Age 34: 11H profection activates Lot of Friends at Aquarius 12¬∞ (natal placement Aquarius 10¬∞) ‚Üí +2pts bonus"

---

## Data-Driven Threshold System (V3.1 Enhancement)

### Problem with Fixed Thresholds

**V3.0 Approach** (arbitrary):
```python
THRESHOLDS = {
    'major': 25,        # ‚Üê Arbitrary number
    'significant': 15,  # ‚Üê Arbitrary number
    'notable': 8        # ‚Üê Arbitrary number
}
```

**Issues**:
- No basis in actual data distribution
- Assumes all profiles have similar eventfulness
- Cannot scale reports based on life complexity
- Some profiles over-reported, others under-reported

### V3.1 Solution: Percentile-Based Adaptive Thresholds

**Philosophy**: Let the DATA determine what's significant for each profile.

**Workflow**:
1. **Add new lots** ‚Üí Regenerate seed data for multiple profiles
2. **Calculate scores** for all ages (0-100) across all profiles
3. **Analyze distribution** ‚Üí Find mean, median, percentiles per profile
4. **Set thresholds** based on percentiles WITHIN each profile's distribution

**Implementation**:
```python
def calculate_adaptive_thresholds(profile_scores: List[int]) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate profile-specific thresholds from score distribution.

    Args:
        profile_scores: List of convergence scores for ages 0-100

    Returns:
        Thresholds dict with major/significant/notable cutoffs
    """
    import numpy as np

    # Calculate percentiles within THIS profile's distribution
    thresholds = {
        'major': np.percentile(profile_scores, 95),      # Top 5% of THEIR events
        'significant': np.percentile(profile_scores, 85), # Top 15% of THEIR events
        'notable': np.percentile(profile_scores, 70)      # Top 30% of THEIR events
    }

    # Ensure minimum separation
    if thresholds['significant'] < thresholds['major'] - 5:
        thresholds['significant'] = thresholds['major'] - 5
    if thresholds['notable'] < thresholds['significant'] - 3:
        thresholds['notable'] = thresholds['significant'] - 3

    return thresholds
```

**Benefit**: Eventful lives (like Darren ages 29-35) ‚Üí More events qualify ‚Üí Longer report ‚úÖ
Quieter lives ‚Üí Fewer events qualify ‚Üí Shorter report ‚úÖ

**Result**: ~15 major events per profile, but based on THEIR distribution, not arbitrary numbers.

### Scoring Distribution Analysis

**Before setting thresholds, analyze across profiles**:

```python
def analyze_scoring_distribution(profiles: List[str]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze score distribution across multiple profiles to validate approach.

    Returns statistics for comparison and threshold validation.
    """
    results = {}

    for profile in profiles:
        scores = calculate_all_ages(profile, start=0, end=100)

        results[profile] = {
            'mean': np.mean(scores),
            'median': np.median(scores),
            'std_dev': np.std(scores),
            'percentiles': {
                '50th': np.percentile(scores, 50),
                '75th': np.percentile(scores, 75),
                '90th': np.percentile(scores, 90),
                '95th': np.percentile(scores, 95),
                '99th': np.percentile(scores, 99),
            },
            'events_above_threshold': {
                'fixed_25': len([s for s in scores if s >= 25]),
                'fixed_15': len([s for s in scores if s >= 15]),
                'adaptive_95th': len([s for s in scores if s >= np.percentile(scores, 95)]),
                'adaptive_85th': len([s for s in scores if s >= np.percentile(scores, 85)]),
            }
        }

    return results
```

**Validation Profiles** (minimum 4):
- Darren_S (eventful ages 29-35)
- Sam_P
- Mom_S
- Jamie_S

**Expected Insight**: Compare fixed vs adaptive thresholds to see which produces more meaningful event counts.

## Timing Point Activations (V3.1 Enhancement)

### New Convergence Factors

V3.1 adds timing point activations from natal calculation enhancements:

**1. Antiscia Activation** (+2 points):
- **Condition**: Profection or ZR activates planet's antiscion within 3¬∞
- **Formula**: Check if profection house contains antiscion of any natal planet
- **Example**: "Age 42: 5H profection activates Moon's antiscion at Leo 15¬∞ (natal Moon Aquarius 15¬∞)"
- **Significance**: TERTIARY testimony activated ‚Üí adds convergence value

**2. Fixed Star Activation** (+3 points):
- **Condition**: Profection activates natal fixed star conjunction within 1¬∞
- **Formula**: Check if profection house contains any of 5 major fixed stars (Regulus, Spica, Algol, Antares, Aldebaran)
- **Example**: "Age 38: 10H profection activates Regulus conjunction to natal Sun (0.5¬∞ orb)"
- **Significance**: Royal star conjunctions activated ‚Üí major timing indicator

**3. Stellium Activation** (+5 points):
- **Condition**: Profection enters house containing 3+ traditional planets (natal stellium)
- **Formula**: Check if profection house matches any stellium house
- **Example**: "Age 28: 5H profection activates 5H stellium (Sun-Mercury-Venus)"
- **Significance**: Concentrated energy activated ‚Üí emphasized period

### Integration into V3 Scoring

```python
# In calculate_convergence_score_v3(), add after profection overlays:

# === TIMING POINT ACTIVATIONS (NEW in V3.1) ===

# Antiscia activation
profection_sign = get_sign_from_house(profection_house, natal_asc_sign)
for planet_antiscia in natal_data['antiscia']:
    if planet_antiscia['antiscion']['sign'] == profection_sign:
        # Check orb within 3¬∞
        if is_within_orb(profection_sign, planet_antiscia['antiscion']['degree'], 3):
            score += 2
            reasons.append(f"Antiscia: {planet_antiscia['planet']} activated")
            break

# Fixed star activation
for fixed_star in natal_data['fixed_stars']['stars']:
    if len(fixed_star['conjunctions']) > 0:  # Has natal conjunctions
        star_sign = fixed_star['position']['sign']
        if star_sign == profection_sign:
            score += 3
            reasons.append(f"Fixed Star: {fixed_star['name']} activated")
            break

# Stellium activation
for stellium in natal_data['stelliums']:
    if stellium['type'] == 'house' and int(stellium['location'].split()[1]) == profection_house:
        score += 5
        reasons.append(f"Stellium activated ({stellium['count']} planets in {profection_house}H)")
        break
```

### Timing Points NOT Used

**Natal Context Only** (not timing points):
- ‚ùå Hayz conditions - Static natal condition, doesn't change
- ‚ùå Planetary conditions (swift/slow, oriental/occidental) - Inform interpretation but not timing
- ‚ùå Aspect dynamics (overcoming, enclosure) - Describes relationships, not timing

These inform HOW activated planets behave, but aren't timing triggers themselves.

   - Major planetary returns: 15pts (Saturn), 8pts (Jupiter)
   - Profection cycles: varies
   - Firdaria major periods: 5pts

2. **Traditional Overlays** (NEW):
   - Loosing of Bond detection: +10pts
   - Peak Period detection: +10pts
   - Climax detection: +5pts
   - Opening Phase detection: +5pts
   - Good house profections: +2-3pts

3. **Contextual Bonuses** (NEW):
   - Saturn Return aftermath: +8pts/year (if difficult) or +3pts/year (if well-placed)
   - Difficult house profections (6H/8H/12H) + malefic activation: +3pts
   - Multiple malefic convergence: +5pts

### Integration Points

**life_arc_generator.py modifications**:
1. Add `assess_saturn_return_difficulty()` function
2. Add `detect_traditional_periods()` function
3. Modify `calculate_convergence_score()` to accept `traditional_periods` and `saturn_assessment`
4. Add `mode='v3'` parameter to `generate_life_arc_timeline()` function
5. Add `calculate_adaptive_thresholds()` function for data-driven thresholds
6. Add timing point activation detection (antiscia, fixed stars, stelliums)
7. Keep backward compatibility: `mode='v2'` uses old scoring

**life-arc-interpreter agents**:
- **BOTH v2 and v3 remain operational** (two separate agents)
- Create new `life-arc-interpreter-v3.md` agent (doesn't replace v2)
- V3 agent calls `generate_life_arc_timeline()` with `mode='v3'`
- V3 agent uses adaptive thresholds from score distribution
- V3 agent interprets traditional periods narratively
- V3 agent provides context for Saturn Return aftermath periods
- V3 agent highlights good periods equivalently to difficult ones
- **User choice**: Can run either v2 or v3 depending on preference

---

## V2 vs V3: Coexistence Strategy

### Why Keep Both Agents?

**V3 is an expansion, not a replacement**:
- V2 remains valid for users who prefer fixed thresholds
- V3 adds data-driven approach for adaptive scaling
- Different philosophies serve different use cases

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | V2 | V3 |
|---------|----|----|
| **Base Convergence** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Traditional Overlays** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Lots System** | 10 lots | **15 lots** (5 new) |
| **Lot of Saturn** | Single interpretation | **Dual interpretation** (Basis/Nemesis) |
| **Thresholds** | **Fixed** (25/15/8) | **Adaptive** (percentile-based) |
| **Timing Points** | Lots only | **Lots + Antiscia + Fixed Stars + Stelliums** |
| **Report Length** | ~15 events (all profiles) | **Scales with eventfulness** |
| **Saturn Return** | Contextual aftermath | Contextual aftermath |
| **Traditional Periods** | Loosing, Peak, Climax | Loosing, Peak, Climax |

### When to Use Which Agent

**Use life-arc-interpreter-v2 when**:
- You want consistent event count across profiles (~15 major events)
- You prefer fixed, predictable thresholds
- You want simpler lots system (10 lots)
- You're comparing reports across multiple profiles with standardized criteria

**Use life-arc-interpreter-v3 when**:
- You want reports that scale with life eventfulness
- You want maximum timing data (15 lots + activation points)
- You want Lot of Saturn interpreted contextually (Basis vs Nemesis)
- You want data-driven, personalized thresholds
- You want the most comprehensive analysis available

### Technical Separation

**Implementation**:
```python
# V2 invocation
timeline_v2 = generate_life_arc_timeline(
    profile='darren',
    start_age=0,
    end_age=100,
    mode='v2'  # Uses fixed thresholds
)

# V3 invocation
timeline_v3 = generate_life_arc_timeline(
    profile='darren',
    start_age=0,
    end_age=100,
    mode='v3'  # Uses adaptive thresholds
)
```

**Output Files**:
- V2: `life_arc_interpretation_darren_ages_0-100_v2.md`
- V3: `life_arc_interpretation_darren_ages_0-100_v3.md`
- **Both can coexist** in same profile's output folder

### User Acceptance Criteria

**UAT 1: Ages 29-35 Coverage**
- ‚úÖ User can read report and see narrative coverage of ages 29-35 difficult period
- ‚úÖ Report explains WHY this period was difficult (Saturn Return + aftermath)
- ‚úÖ Report provides context (natal Saturn condition, when relief comes)

**UAT 2: Traditional Periods Highlighted**
- ‚úÖ Loosing of Bond periods are described narratively (not just scored)
- ‚úÖ Peak periods are highlighted as empowered/smooth phases
- ‚úÖ Reader understands traditional astrological concepts without jargon

**UAT 3: Good Periods Balanced**
- ‚úÖ Fortunate periods (11H years, peak periods) receive equivalent narrative weight
- ‚úÖ Report doesn't feel like "doom and gloom" - shows opportunities too

**UAT 4: Clarity Maintained**
- ‚úÖ ~15 major events across 100 years (not overwhelming)
- ‚úÖ Clear chapter structure around L1 periods
- ‚úÖ Current age position clearly marked

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should climax periods receive more weight than +5pts? (Currently midpoint of L1 gets +5pts)
- [ ] Should we detect "void" periods (no significant scoring) and mention them as "quieter times"?
- [ ] How to handle multiple Saturn Returns (ages 29, 58, 87)? Same contextual assessment each time?
- [ ] Should Jupiter Returns also get contextual assessment (though less intense than Saturn)?

## Decision Log

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered | Date |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|------|
| Contextual Saturn Return scoring | Captures multi-year aftermath based on natal condition, addressing core user pain point | Fixed 15pts for all returns, ignoring aftermath | 2025-10-12 |
| Keep L2 data, score selectively | Allows peak period and loosing detection while reducing noise | Remove L2 entirely (V2 approach - too aggressive) | 2025-10-12 |
| +10pts for Loosing of Bond | Traditional significance warrants high bonus regardless of convergence | Lower bonus (5pts), or no bonus | 2025-10-12 |
| +10pts for Peak Periods | Balances difficult period emphasis with traditional fortunate periods | Different bonus values, or omit entirely | 2025-10-12 |
| **Data-driven thresholds** (V3.1) | Let data distribution determine significance thresholds; allows reports to scale with eventfulness | Keep fixed thresholds (25/15/8) | **2025-10-15** |
| **15 lots system** (V3.1) | Adds relational/family/social timing data; all traditional sources | Keep 10 lots only, or add modern lots | **2025-10-15** |
| **Lot of Saturn dual interpretation** (V3.1) | Same formula, different meaning based on Saturn's natal dignity; honors traditional Saturn duality | Create two separate lots with different formulas | **2025-10-15** |
| **Exclude Lot of Exaltation & Commerce** (V3.1) | Cannot verify formulas in traditional sources; maintain authenticity | Include anyway, mark as uncertain | **2025-10-15** |
| **Add timing point activations** (V3.1) | Antiscia, fixed stars, stelliums already calculated; activate as timing points when profections hit them | Ignore these calculated points for timing | **2025-10-15** |
| **Keep both v2 and v3 agents** (V3.1) | Different philosophies serve different use cases; v3 is expansion not replacement | Replace v2 with v3 | **2025-10-15** |
| Saturn aftermath 3-5 years if difficult | Matches user experience (ages 29-35 = 6 years including return) | Fixed 3 years for all, or no aftermath at all | 2025-10-12 |
| mode='v3' parameter for backward compat | V1/V2 agents continue working during transition | Break existing function signature | 2025-10-12 |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 3.1-draft | 2025-10-15 | **V3.1 Enhancements**: Expanded lots system (15 lots), Lot of Saturn dual interpretation (Basis/Nemesis), data-driven percentile-based thresholds, timing point activations (antiscia, fixed stars, stelliums), V2/V3 coexistence strategy, Phase 0 implementation plan added |
| 3.0-draft | 2025-10-12 | Initial V3 specification created from collaborative design session |

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Test Case - Darren's Chart Ages 29-39

**Natal Saturn Assessment**:
- Position: Capricorn 5¬∞ (domicile)
- House: 6H (health/service - traditionally difficult)
- Sect: Night chart ‚Üí Saturn is malefic contrary to sect (PRIMARY challenge)
- Aspects: Conjunct Sun 0.88¬∞ orb (very tight)
- Assessment: difficulty_level='difficult', aftermath_years=3-5, aftermath_bonus=8

**Expected V3 Scores**:

| Age | V2 Score | V3 Score | V3 Bonuses | Tier |
|-----|----------|----------|------------|------|
| 29 | 15 | 28 | Saturn Return (15) + 6H profection (3) + malefic ruled (2) + convergence (8) | MAJOR |
| 30 | 5 | 13 | Aftermath year 1 (8) + profection (5) | NOTABLE |
| 31 | 8 | 16 | Aftermath year 2 (8) + profection (8) | SIGNIFICANT |
| 32 | 13 | 21 | Aftermath year 3 (8) + profection (13) | SIGNIFICANT |
| 33 | 8 | 16 | Aftermath year 4 (8) + profection (8) | SIGNIFICANT |
| 34 | 5 | 13 | Aftermath year 5 (8) + profection (5) | NOTABLE |
| 35 | 8 | 18 | 12H profection (3) + Loosing starts (10) + other (5) | SIGNIFICANT |
| 37 | 5 | 15 | Loosing of Bond (10) + profection (5) | SIGNIFICANT |
| 38 | 8 | 18 | Loosing of Bond (10) + profection (8) | SIGNIFICANT |
| 39 | 33 | 43+ | L1 transition (15) + Loosing ends (10) + Peak begins (10) + profection (8) | MAJOR |

**Narrative Impact**:
- Ages 29-35: "Saturn Return and Rebuilding (Ages 29-35)" becomes dedicated narrative section
- Ages 37-39: "Preparation for Major Shift (Ages 37-39)" - Loosing of Bond coverage
- Age 39: "Profound Relief - The Aquarius Chapter Begins" - major transition with peak period
