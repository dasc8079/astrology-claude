# Session Goals Comparison

## Current session_goals.md (871 lines)
**Source**: iCloud (copied to local)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04
**Nature**: Mixes high-level vision WITH detailed tactical implementation

### What it Contains:
- ✅ North Star Vision (4 modes, ultimate goal)
- ✅ Speculative future features
- ✅ Current state assessment
- ❌ **DETAILED** Stage -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 implementation plans
- ❌ **DETAILED** Sub-stages (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc.)
- ❌ Success criteria for each stage
- ❌ Deliverables and testing phases
- ❌ CLI command examples
- ❌ Output specifications with examples
- ❌ Technology stack details
- ❌ Agent ownership breakdown
- ❌ Current status tracking ("Stage 1.3 IN PROGRESS")

### Issues:
1. **Outdated**: Says "Stage 1.3 IN PROGRESS" but Mode 2 is actually complete
2. **Too detailed**: Belongs in CURRENT_WORK.md or project plans, not vision doc
3. **Hard to maintain**: Changes frequently, gets stale quickly
4. **Mixes concerns**: Strategic vision mixed with tactical execution

## Current CURRENT_WORK.md (145 lines)
**Source**: Local only (new framework)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-06
**Nature**: Clean tactical current work tracking

### What it Contains:
- ✅ Current focus (Mode 2 complete)
- ✅ Completed stages (brief list)
- ✅ Mode status table
- ✅ Key files delivered
- ✅ Next steps
- ✅ Agent coordination
- ✅ References to other docs

### Strengths:
1. **Current**: Accurately reflects state as of Oct 6
2. **Concise**: Just what you need to know RIGHT NOW
3. **Easy to update**: Only changes when work changes
4. **Clear separation**: Tactics, not strategy

## Recommended Structure

### session_goals.md (HIGH-LEVEL VISION) ~150 lines
**Purpose**: The unchanging North Star
**Updates**: Rarely (only when vision changes)

**Should contain**:
- North Star Vision (4 modes)
- Ultimate goal and principles
- Speculative future features
- Success factors (what makes this succeed)
- Non-goals (what we're NOT doing)
- High-level mode descriptions
- Documentation strategy overview

**Should NOT contain**:
- Current status
- Detailed stage plans
- Implementation steps
- Deliverables and testing
- Code examples
- Current work tracking

### CURRENT_WORK.md (TACTICAL EXECUTION) ~100-200 lines
**Purpose**: What's happening RIGHT NOW
**Updates**: Frequently (after major work)

**Should contain** (ALREADY DOES):
- Current focus
- Active work and status
- Completed stages (brief)
- Mode status table
- Key files and paths
- Next steps
- Agent coordination

## What to Do

**Option 1: Simplify session_goals.md**
- Strip out all detailed stages/substages
- Keep only North Star vision and principles
- Move outdated implementation details to archive or delete

**Option 2: Use CURRENT_WORK.md as primary, archive session_goals.md**
- Continue with the new framework
- Archive old session_goals.md to /archive/session_goals_OLD.md
- Create minimal new session_goals.md from scratch with just vision

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Simplify session_goals.md to vision only (~150 lines)
- Keep CURRENT_WORK.md for tactical work
- Both files serve clear separate purposes

---

## My Recommendation

**Option 3**: Simplify session_goals.md to vision-only, keep CURRENT_WORK.md

**Why**:
- Clear separation of concerns (strategy vs tactics)
- session_goals.md becomes stable reference (rarely changes)
- CURRENT_WORK.md stays dynamic and current
- Both are useful for different purposes
- Matches the documentation framework you migrated to

**Next Step**:
I can create a simplified session_goals.md (~150 lines) with:
1. North Star Vision
2. 4 Modes overview
3. Ultimate goal
4. Speculative features
5. Success factors
6. Non-goals
7. Principles and documentation strategy

Then move all the detailed Stage 1.1, 1.2, etc. content to archive or delete it (since it's outdated anyway - Mode 2 is complete).
