# Hierarchical Weighting Specification

**Version**: 2.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18
**Applies To**: All interpretation agents (natal, life arc, transit)

---

## Purpose

This document defines the complete hierarchical weighting system for astrological interpretation, specifying which chart factors are PRIMARY, SECONDARY, or TERTIARY by default, and the dynamic rules that elevate factors up the hierarchy.

**Foundation**: Traditional/Hellenistic astrology with modern psychological integration.

---

## Core Principle

**Not all chart factors are created equal.** Traditional astrology teaches that some factors are inherently more important (PRIMARY) while others provide context (SECONDARY/TERTIARY). This hierarchy ensures interpretations are focused, clear, and avoid overwhelming the reader with equal-weight factors.

**Dynamic weighting** allows TERTIARY factors to become PRIMARY when they participate in significant configurations (tight conjunctions, angular placement, etc.).

---

## Base Hierarchical Weights by Body Type

### Traditional Planets (Sun through Saturn)

**Base Weight**: Determined by **Essential Dignity + Accidental Dignity**

**Essential Dignity Hierarchy:**
1. **Domicile** (e.g., Mars in Aries) → PRIMARY strength
2. **Exaltation** (e.g., Jupiter in Cancer) → PRIMARY strength
3. **Triplicity, Terms, Decans** → SECONDARY/TERTIARY strength
4. **Peregrine** (no dignity) → Neutral/challenged
5. **Detriment** (e.g., Mars in Libra) → PRIMARY challenge
6. **Fall** (e.g., Jupiter in Capricorn) → PRIMARY challenge

**Accidental Dignity Hierarchy:**
1. **Angular houses** (1st, 10th, 7th, 4th) → PRIMARY effectiveness
2. **Succedent houses** (2nd, 11th, 8th, 5th) → SECONDARY effectiveness
3. **Cadent houses** (3rd, 12th, 9th, 6th) → TERTIARY effectiveness
4. **Planetary Joys** → Dignity boost when planet in its joy house

**Combined Examples:**
- Jupiter in Cancer (exaltation) in 11th (angular + joy) = **MAXIMUM PRIMARY**
- Mars in Aries (domicile) in 12th (cadent) = **Strong PRIMARY but less effective**
- Saturn in Cancer (detriment) in 12th (cadent) = **Maximum challenge**

---

### Outer Planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto)

**Base Weight**: **SECONDARY** (generational/psychological context)

**Rationale**:
- Outer planets spend years/decades in each sign → generational themes
- Traditional seven planets change signs more frequently → personal expression
- **Chris Brennan**: "Outer planets represent collective consciousness shifts, not personal expression"
- **Demetra George**: "Use traditional rulers for delineation; outer planets add context"

**Elevation Rules**:
- <1° conjunct PRIMARY factor → Elevate to PRIMARY
- Angular + well-aspected → Elevate to PRIMARY
- Otherwise remain SECONDARY context

---

### Chiron & Lilith

**Base Weight**: **TERTIARY** (additional psychological context)

**Rationale**:
- Not traditional Hellenistic bodies
- Modern psychological integration points
- Valuable when activated by PRIMARY factors

**Elevation Rules**:
- <1° conjunct PRIMARY factor (especially sect light or angular planet) → Elevate to PRIMARY
- 1-3° conjunct PRIMARY factor → Elevate to SECONDARY minimum
- Angular placement alone → Elevate to SECONDARY
- Otherwise remain TERTIARY (mention only if relevant)

**Critical**: When Chiron/Lilith are elevated to PRIMARY via tight conjunction, interpret as UNIT with the PRIMARY factor (wounded teacher, shadow partner, etc.), NOT separately.

---

### Lots (Arabic Parts)

**For Natal Interpretation** (4 Essential Hermetic Lots):
1. **Lot of Fortune** (Moon) → Body, resources, material wellbeing
2. **Lot of Spirit** (Sun) → Career, purpose, life direction
3. **Lot of Eros** (Venus) → Desire, love, passionate attachment
4. **Lot of Necessity** (Mercury) → Fate, constraint, compulsion

**Base Weight**: **PRIMARY when in key houses**, SECONDARY otherwise

**Key House Placements**:
- Lot of Fortune in 1st/2nd/10th → PRIMARY (body, resources, public standing)
- Lot of Spirit in 10th/9th/1st → PRIMARY (career, purpose, identity)
- Lot of Eros in 5th/7th/8th → PRIMARY (romance, partnership, intimacy)
- Lot of Necessity in 6th/12th → PRIMARY (fate, constraint, hidden factors)

**For Life Arc Interpretation** (7 Hermetic Lots):
- Add: Lot of Courage (Mars), Lot of Victory (Jupiter), Lot of Saturn (Basis/Nemesis)
- These track timing phases across decades

---

### Nodes (North & South)

**Base Weight**: **TERTIARY** (modifiers, not primary factors)

**Traditional Hellenistic View**:
- **North Node** = point of increase (amplifies planets it aspects)
- **South Node** = point of decrease (diminishes planets it aspects)
- Associated with eclipses and danger zones
- NOT karmic (that's modern interpretation)

**Elevation Rules**:
- <3° conjunct planet → Elevate to SECONDARY (modifies that planet's expression)
- North Node amplifies planet's gifts
- South Node creates release/decrease of planet's expression

**Interpretation Approach**:
- Don't interpret nodes as standalone factors
- Interpret as MODIFIERS of the planets they aspect
- Example: "Venus conjunct North Node amplifies your relational gifts and social magnetism"

---

### Angles (Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, IC)

**CRITICAL UPDATE**: Angles are PRIMARY factors in traditional astrology.

**Angle Signs as PRIMARY:**
- **Ascendant sign** → PRIMARY (identity foundation, how others experience you)
- **Midheaven sign** → PRIMARY (public role foundation, career direction)
- **Descendant sign** → SECONDARY (relationship approach, partner type)
- **IC sign** → SECONDARY (roots, foundation, private self)

**Chart Ruler (ASC ruler)** → ALWAYS PRIMARY
**MC Ruler (10th house ruler)** → ALWAYS PRIMARY
**DSC Ruler** → SECONDARY minimum
**IC Ruler** → SECONDARY minimum

---

### Fixed Stars

**Base Weight**: **TERTIARY** (rare mentions only)

**Usage**: Mention when conjunct planet/angle within 1° orb
- Spica (benefic) - gifts, protection, success
- Algol (malefic) - intensity, transformation challenges
- Regulus (royal) - leadership, prominence
- Antares (intense) - crisis, breakthrough
- Fomalhaut (mystical) - spirituality, idealism

**Only 5 major stars tracked** to avoid clutter.

---

### Antiscia

**Base Weight**: **TERTIARY** (hidden symmetries)

**Usage**: Mention only when within 3° of planet/angle
- Reveals hidden connections via mirror degrees
- Most useful in timing work (transits, profections)
- In natal work, mention sparingly

---

## Sect Hierarchy (Day vs Night Chart)

**Sect is a PRIMARY factor** that colors ALL planetary interpretations.

### Day Chart (Sun above horizon):
- **Sect light**: Sun → PRIMARY
- **Benefic of sect**: Jupiter → PRIMARY for gifts
- **Malefic of sect**: Saturn → SECONDARY for challenges
- **Malefic contrary to sect**: Mars → PRIMARY for challenges (intensified)

### Night Chart (Sun below horizon):
- **Sect light**: Moon → PRIMARY
- **Benefic of sect**: Venus → PRIMARY for gifts
- **Malefic of sect**: Mars → SECONDARY for challenges
- **Malefic contrary to sect**: Saturn → PRIMARY for challenges (intensified)

---

## House Analysis Hierarchy (For Any Life Area)

This is the foundation of traditional delineation:

1. **PRIMARY**: WHERE does house ruler go? (house ruler placement)
2. **PRIMARY**: WHAT is in the house? (planets in house)
3. **SECONDARY**: HOW is it modified? (aspects to ruler, aspects to planets in house)
4. **TERTIARY**: Additional context (angle sign, minor dignities)

**Example - 7th House (Partnership)**:
- PRIMARY: 7th ruler in 5th house (partnerships through creative/romantic contexts)
- PRIMARY: Venus in 7th house (relationship-focused, partnership themes central)
- SECONDARY: Moon trine 7th ruler (emotional support for partnerships)
- TERTIARY: 7th house in Aries (initiating, direct approach to relationships)

---

## Dynamic Weighting Rules (Elevation Up the Hierarchy)

These rules elevate planets/factors from their base weight to higher importance. **Never demote - only elevate.**

### Rule 1: Tight Conjunction to PRIMARY Factor ⭐ CRITICAL

When ANY body (including Chiron, Lilith, outer planets) is conjunct a PRIMARY factor:

- **<1° orb** → Elevate to PRIMARY, analyze as UNIT with the PRIMARY factor
- **1-3° orb** → Elevate to SECONDARY minimum, integrate into PRIMARY interpretation
- **3-5° orb** → TERTIARY (minor influence)

**Critical synthesis rule**: DO NOT discuss them separately. The conjunction IS the theme.

**Examples**:
- Sun conjunct Chiron (0.36°) → Chiron elevated to PRIMARY → "Wounded identity, healing through self-expression"
- Jupiter conjunct Uranus (0.8°) → Uranus elevated to PRIMARY → "Revolutionary expansion, unconventional wisdom"
- Mars conjunct Lilith (2.1°) → Lilith elevated to SECONDARY → "Shadow assertion, primal desire integration"

---

### Rule 2: Planets Conjunct Angles

When a planet (including Chiron/Lilith/outer planets) is conjunct an angle:

- **<3° to ASC or MC** → Elevate to PRIMARY (highly visible in identity/public role)
- **<3° to DSC or IC** → Elevate to SECONDARY minimum (visible in relationships/roots)
- **3-5° to any angle** → TERTIARY (angular influence present)

**Angular conjunctions are extremely powerful** in traditional astrology - they make planets highly visible and effective.

**Examples**:
- Chiron conjunct MC (0.64°) → Chiron PRIMARY → "Public wound/healing mission visible in career"
- Saturn conjunct IC (4.05°) → Saturn SECONDARY → "Foundational responsibility, ancestral weight"

---

### Rule 3: Sect Light Illumination

Planets conjunct the sect light (Sun in day chart, Moon in night chart) receive "illumination":

- **<1° to sect light** → Elevate to PRIMARY (illuminated identity core)
- **1-3° to sect light** → Elevate to SECONDARY minimum (visible expression)
- **Opposition to sect light** → SECONDARY (tension with core identity)

**This rule reinforces Rule #1** when the PRIMARY factor is the sect light.

---

### Rule 4: Stellium Amplification

When 3+ planets occupy same angular house or sign:

- **ALL participating planets** → SECONDARY minimum (even if cadent or peregrine individually)
- **Tight stellium (<10° spread)** → Treat as single PRIMARY unit
- **Stellium ruler** → Importance amplified (connects stellium energy to another area)

**Synthesis approach**: Discuss stellium planets as thematic cluster, not individually.

**Example**: Sun, Mercury, Jupiter in Cancer 10th house (tight stellium) → PRIMARY career/public role focus with teaching/communication/expansion themes woven together

---

### Rule 5: Mutual Reception

When two planets are in each other's dignities:

- **Strong reception (both domicile)** → Both planets SECONDARY minimum
- **Mixed reception (domicile + exaltation)** → Stronger planet SECONDARY
- **Weak reception (triplicity/bounds)** → Minor boost only if angular

**Synthesis approach**: Discuss as cooperative pair mitigating difficult placements.

**Example**: Mars in Libra (detriment) + Venus in Aries (detriment) = mutual reception → These challenging placements support each other through exchange

---

### Rule 6: Malefic Contrary to Sect (AUTOMATIC)

The "worst" malefic receives automatic elevation for challenges:

- **Day chart**: Mars is malefic contrary to sect → SECONDARY minimum for challenges, PRIMARY if angular
- **Night chart**: Saturn is malefic contrary to sect → SECONDARY minimum for challenges, PRIMARY if angular
- **Malefic of sect**: TERTIARY if cadent/peregrine (less harsh)

---

### Rule 7: House Ruler Minimums (AUTOMATIC)

Rulers of angular houses receive minimum weights regardless of condition:

- **Chart ruler (ASC)** → ALWAYS PRIMARY
- **MC ruler** → ALWAYS PRIMARY
- **DSC ruler** → SECONDARY minimum
- **IC ruler** → SECONDARY minimum

---

## The 15-Point Integration Formula

For EACH life-area section, weave together ALL relevant techniques naturally, applying hierarchical weighting:

1. **Essential Dignities** (domicile, exaltation, triplicity, terms, decans) - Planet's STRENGTH
2. **Accidental Dignities** (angularity, speed, hayz, oriental/occidental, joys) - Planet's EFFECTIVENESS
3. **House Ruler Analysis** - WHERE this life area unfolds (PRIMARY)
4. **Planets in House** - WHAT energies are active (PRIMARY)
5. **Aspects to Ruler/Planets** - SUPPORT or CHALLENGE (SECONDARY)
6. **Aspect Patterns** (T-squares, grand trines, stelliums) - Larger stories (HIGH priority if present)
7. **Lot Placements** - WHERE themes manifest (PRIMARY if in key houses)
8. **Sect Layering** - Colors EVERY planet (PRIMARY factor)
9. **Receptions & Bonification** - Hidden support (SECONDARY)
10. **Stellium Influence** - Gravitational center (PRIMARY if present)
11. **Planetary Conditions** (combustion, cazimi, stationary, swift/slow, etc.)
12. **Antiscia Connections** - Hidden symmetries (TERTIARY, only if <3° to planet/angle)
13. **Angle Aspects** - Planets aspecting ASC/MC/DSC/IC (MEDIUM priority)
14. **Chart Ruler Emphasis** - Overall life expression (PRIMARY)
15. **Final Dispositor** - Ultimate authority (SECONDARY for synthesis)

**Word Allocation by Tier**:
- PRIMARY factors: 70-80% of word count
- SECONDARY factors: 15-20% of word count
- TERTIARY factors: 5-10% of word count (or omit if space limited)

**Language Patterns**:
- PRIMARY: "Your life centers on...", "The core pattern is...", "Most fundamentally..."
- SECONDARY: "This is modified by...", "Additionally...", "Supporting this pattern..."
- TERTIARY: "As a minor note...", "Also present...", "Worth mentioning..."

---

## Settings Workflow: "Bake Into Seed Data"

**OLD APPROACH** (❌ Token-inefficient):
- Agent reads profile.md to check `include_chiron: true/false`
- Agent decides whether to interpret Chiron
- ~100 tokens per interpretation agent

**NEW APPROACH** (✅ Token-efficient):
- `seed_data_generator.py` reads profile.md settings
- Only calculates/includes bodies that are enabled
- Seed data contains ONLY what should be interpreted
- Agent instructions: "Interpret all planetary bodies present in seed_data"
- ~20 tokens per interpretation agent

**Infrastructure**: Already implemented in `seed_data_generator.py` (lines 183-236, 1385-1396)

**Agent simplification**: Remove Step 3.5 entirely. Agents just interpret whatever bodies exist in seed data according to hierarchical weighting rules.
