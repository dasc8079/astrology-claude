# Astrology Exclusions & Rejected Methods

**Purpose**: Document astrological methods we've CONSIDERED but chosen NOT to use, with rationale for each decision.

**For methods we DO use**: See [ASTROLOGY_REFERENCE.md](ASTROLOGY_REFERENCE.md)

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18

## Why This Document Exists

As the project evolves, we encounter various astrological techniques, bodies, and systems. This document prevents:
- Re-evaluating the same methods repeatedly
- Bloating the main reference guide with negative definitions
- Forgetting WHY we made certain exclusions
- Future contributors asking "why don't we use X?"

**Principle**: Document the decision + rationale, not just the exclusion.

## Asteroids (NOT INCLUDED)

### The Four Major Asteroids

**Excluded Bodies**:
- ⚳ Ceres (nurturing, caregiving, loss)
- ⚴ Pallas (wisdom, strategy, creative intelligence)
- ⚵ Juno (partnership, commitment, marriage dynamics)
- ⚶ Vesta (devotion, sacred focus, sexuality as focus)

### Rationale for Exclusion

**Research Finding** (2025-10-18):
> "Asteroids are often ignored within mainstream systems of astrology, especially in more traditional astrology systems like Vedic astrology or Hellenistic astrology. Their use has become significant to a few Western astrologers yet still only a minority of astrologers use the asteroids in chart interpretation."

**Overlap with Existing System**:
- **Ceres** ≈ Moon (emotional nurturing) + 4th house themes
- **Pallas** ≈ Mercury (thinking) + creative intelligence already covered
- **Juno** ≈ 7th house (partnerships) + Venus/Mars relationship dynamics
- **Vesta** ≈ Lot of Spirit (devotion to purpose) + sexuality themes in 5th/8th houses

**Decision**: These themes are already well-covered by traditional planets, house analysis, and lots. Adding asteroids would:
- Increase complexity without proportional insight
- Dilute focus from traditional planetary testimonies
- Add 4 more bodies to track per chart (token cost, interpretation overhead)

**Could be reconsidered IF**: Future user specifically requests asteroid-focused interpretation and is willing to accept the added complexity.

## Additional Lots (LIMITED USE)

### Life-Area Lots (Not Used for Natal Interpretation)

**Lots calculated but NOT emphasized in natal work**:
- Lot of Exaltation (career peak, honors)
- Lot of Marriage (partnership dynamics)
- Lot of Children (offspring, legacy)
- Lot of Father (paternal relationships)
- Lot of Mother (maternal relationships)
- Lot of Siblings (peer relationships)
- Lot of Accusation (legal issues, conflicts)
- Lot of Friends (social networks)

### Rationale for Limited Use

**Redundancy with House System**:
- Houses already cover these topics comprehensively:
  - 7th house = marriage (not Lot of Marriage)
  - 5th house = children (not Lot of Children)
  - 3rd house = siblings (not Lot of Siblings)
  - 11th house = friends (not Lot of Friends)
  - 10th house = mother, 4th house = father (traditional assignments)

**Chris Brennan's Approach**:
- Focus on Fortune, Spirit, Eros, Necessity as ESSENTIAL
- Additional lots for specialized timing work, not natal interpretation

**Decision**:
- **Natal interpretation**: Use 4 essential Hermetic Lots only
- **Life arc/timing interpretation**: Use all 7 Hermetic Lots (adds Courage, Victory, Saturn)
- **Specialized lots**: Calculate but don't emphasize to avoid clutter

**Could be reconsidered IF**: Specific life-area lot provides unique insight house analysis doesn't capture.

## Modern Rulership System (NOT USED)

### Modern Planetary Rulers

**Excluded Rulerships**:
- Uranus as ruler of Aquarius (traditional ruler: Saturn)
- Neptune as ruler of Pisces (traditional ruler: Jupiter)
- Pluto as ruler of Scorpio (traditional ruler: Mars)

### Rationale for Exclusion

**Demetra George** (*Ancient Astrology in Theory and Practice*):
> "When practicing traditional astrology, use the traditional rulers - Saturn for Aquarius and Capricorn, Jupiter for Pisces and Sagittarius, and Mars for Scorpio and Aries."

> "The modern outer planets were arbitrarily given certain signs to rule, and the reasoning behind these relationships is not altogether clear, as the modern rulerships do not conform to the inherent underlying order and symmetry that exists in the original system."

**Practical Example from Demetra George**:
> "When analyzing wealth in a chart where Scorpio occupies the second house, using Mars as the traditional ruler of Scorpio provides clear delineation, whereas using Pluto would not yield the same results."

**Decision**: Traditional rulerships preserve the coherent symmetry of the original system. Modern rulerships were "arbitrarily assigned" without traditional logic.

**What We DO**: Use outer planets for psychological context and generational themes, but NOT as sign rulers.

## Minor Aspects (NOT USED)

### Excluded Aspects

**Not calculated or interpreted**:
- Semi-sextile (30°)
- Quincunx/Inconjunct (150°)
- Semi-square (45°)
- Sesquiquadrate (135°)
- Quintile (72°)
- Bi-quintile (144°)

### Rationale for Exclusion

**Traditional Hellenistic Standard**:
- Classical aspects (conjunction, sextile, square, trine, opposition) are the foundation
- These 5 aspects have clear significations and consistent behavior

**Clarity Over Completeness**:
- Minor aspects add complexity without proportional interpretive value
- Can create "aspect soup" where everything aspects everything
- Traditional astrologers achieved profound insights with 5 classical aspects

**Decision**: Classical aspects provide sufficient nuance. Minor aspects would dilute the clear testimonies from major aspects.

**Could be reconsidered IF**: Specific research shows minor aspects add significant predictive value in timing work.

## Modern House Systems (NOT USED)

### Excluded House Systems

**Not used for calculation or interpretation**:
- Placidus (most popular modern system)
- Koch
- Regiomontanus
- Campanus
- Equal House (from ASC)
- Porphyry

### Rationale for Exclusion

**Whole-Sign Houses (WSH) Used Instead**:
- Traditional Hellenistic standard
- Each house = one complete zodiacal sign
- Simple, clear boundaries (no interceptions)
- Works seamlessly with timing techniques (zodiacal releasing, profections)

**Chris Brennan** (*Hellenistic Astrology*):
> "Whole sign houses were the original form of house division in Hellenistic astrology and remained the dominant system for over 1000 years."

**Practical Benefits**:
- House ruler analysis straightforward (entire sign ruled by one planet)
- Zodiacal releasing calculations depend on whole-sign houses
- Annual profections use whole-sign houses
- No ambiguity about which house a planet occupies

**Decision**: WSH provides traditional foundation + practical advantages. Modern quadrant systems (Placidus, Koch) complicate without improving accuracy.

**Could be reconsidered IF**: User requests comparison between house systems or has strong preference for quadrant houses.

## Karmic/Evolutionary Interpretations (MINIMAL)

### Limited Use of Karmic Concepts

**Approaches minimized or excluded**:
- Past life interpretations of nodes (modern addition)
- Karma as primary interpretive lens
- Soul evolution narrative framework
- Reincarnation-focused delineations

### Rationale for Limited Use

**Traditional Hellenistic View**:
- Nodes = points of increase (North) and decrease (South)
- Associated with eclipses and danger zones
- NOT karmic in traditional sources

**Research Finding** (2025-10-18):
> "There's no evidence in Hellenistic astrology that the nodes hold any karmic ties. Modern interpretation of the nodes can be traced to Rudhyar's 1936 book and Schulman's 1975 book, though these theories do not come from traditional Vedic or Western astrological traditions."

**What We DO**:
- North Node = amplifies planets it aspects (point of increase)
- South Node = diminishes planets it aspects (point of decrease)
- Growth direction vs release point (modern psychological framing acceptable)
- NO past life narratives or karmic debt language

**Decision**: Traditional testimony provides sufficient framework. Karmic interpretations are unfalsifiable and not grounded in traditional sources.

**Could be reconsidered IF**: User explicitly requests evolutionary astrology approach and understands it's a modern overlay.

## Dignities & Receptions (SELECTIVE USE)

### Excluded or Minimized Dignity Systems

**Used minimally**:
- Decan/Face rulers (Chaldean order) - TERTIARY
- Term/Bound rulers (Egyptian system) - TERTIARY
- Mutual reception by decan/face (too weak to emphasize)

**Not tracked**:
- Ptolemaic terms (different system than Egyptian)
- Vedic/Jyotish dignity systems (different tradition)
- Modern dignity schemes (not traditional)

### Rationale for Selective Use

**Hierarchy of Dignity Importance**:
1. Domicile/Exaltation - PRIMARY (extremely important)
2. Detriment/Fall - PRIMARY challenges (extremely important)
3. Triplicity - SECONDARY (moderate importance)
4. Terms/Bounds - TERTIARY (minor importance)
5. Decans/Faces - TERTIARY (minor importance)

**Practical Clarity**:
- Emphasizing minor dignities (terms, faces) can obscure major testimonies
- A planet in detriment with minor dignity (term) is still weakened overall
- Focus on essential + accidental dignity (angularity) for clearest picture

**What We DO**:
- Calculate and include terms/faces in seed data (complete data)
- Mention in interpretation ONLY if they modify major testimony
- Example: "Saturn in Cancer (detriment) but in Saturn's own term (minor support)"

**Decision**: Calculate all dignities for completeness, but hierarchically weight interpretations toward domicile/exaltation/angularity.

## Version History

**v1.0** (2025-10-18):
- Initial documentation of exclusions
- Asteroids excluded (Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta)
- Life-area lots limited to timing work
- Modern rulerships not used
- Minor aspects not calculated
- Modern house systems not used
- Karmic interpretations minimized
- Minor dignities de-emphasized

---

## Future Considerations

**Methods to Re-evaluate Later**:
1. **Asteroids** - If compelling research emerges or user specifically requests
2. **Life-area lots** - May be valuable for specialized consultations
3. **Minor aspects** - Could be useful in electional/horary work
4. **Alternative house systems** - May offer interesting comparative analysis

**Principle**: Exclusions are not permanent. We remain open to reconsidering based on:
- New research validating excluded methods
- User needs requiring specific techniques
- Compelling traditional source material we missed
