  - L1 periods (main life chapters), L2 sub-periods
  - Peak period detection (L1/L2 alignment)
  - Shows all periods with exact dates and ages
  - ZODIACAL_RELEASING_GUIDE.md created
  - Tested with both Fortune and Spirit lots

**Current Task**: Stage 4 - Life Arc Timeline Integration
- Design unified timeline combining profections + ZR
- Create life_arc_generator.py for timeline synthesis
- Format 100-year life narrative with major periods
- Test complete system with real birth data

2. **Create life_arc_generator.py** - Generate integrated 100-year timeline
3. **Format life arc report** - Present major periods, turning points, themes
4. **Test complete system** - Validate with real birth data from profiles
5. **Add narrative synthesis** - AI-generated interpretation of life chapters

## üìö Design Documents

**Active**:
- `/docs/life_arc_report_design.md` - 105-page comprehensive design (Stage 0 complete)
- `/docs/seed_data_schema.yaml` - Complete seed data structure
- `/docs/session_goals.md` - North Star vision (maintained by workflow-planner-2)

**Deferred**:
- `/docs/transit_interpretation_design.md` - Transit enhancement research (moved after Life Arc)
- `/docs/transit_staged_implementation.md` - Transit rollout plan (moved after Life Arc)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

**Seed Data Strategy**:
- **Structured files** (YAML) for calculated facts
- **RAG database** for traditional interpretations
- **Hybrid approach**: Chat queries both sources
- **Unified generator**: Expands with each mode (natal ‚Üí life arc ‚Üí transits)

**Documentation Structure** (NEW):
- `CURRENT_WORK.md` - This file (what's happening NOW)
- `REFERENCE.md` - Static astrology knowledge
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - How to contribute
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `/history/` - Archived completed stages

---

## ü§ñ Agent Coordination

**Project-Specific Agents**:
- `docs-updater-astrology` - Updates this file + project docs (being updated for new structure)
- `workflow-planner-2` - Maintains session_goals.md, technical recommendations
- `natal-interpreter` - Generates natal horoscope synthesis
- `astrology-rag-builder` - Maintains RAG database

**Global Agents** (from `~/.claude/agents/`):
- `history-manager` - Archives completed stages to `/history/`

---

## üí° Remember

- **Synthesis agents** (natal-interpreter, future life-arc agent) require user approval before modification
- **Narrative style preferred**: Flowing prose, not bullet points
- **House rulers critical**: Integrate naturally throughout interpretations
- **Traditional foundation protected**: Modern methods clearly labeled, always secondary
