# Dynamic Weighting Specification

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Purpose**: Define rules for dynamically adjusting planetary importance based on context (aspects, houses, patterns)

---

## Problem Statement

The current hierarchical testimony framework uses **static weights** based on:
- Essential dignity (domicile, exaltation, detriment, fall)
- Accidental dignity (angular, succedent, cadent)

This creates accurate base weighting but **underweights planets in critical configurations**:

**Example**: Chiron (peregrine, modern planet) would be rated TERTIARY by static system. But Chiron conjunct Jupiter exalted in 10th house (0.36° orb) creates "wounded teacher" archetype - a PRIMARY theme that transcends Chiron's lack of dignity.

**Solution**: Add dynamic weight boosting rules that elevate planets when they participate in significant configurations.

---

## Core Principle

**Hierarchy remains**: PRIMARY (domicile/exalt + angular) > SECONDARY (minor dignities/succedent) > TERTIARY (peregrine/cadent)

**Dynamic boosts**: Context-based rules can elevate planets UP the hierarchy (never down)

**Thematic synthesis**: Multiple factors pointing to same theme should be discussed as UNIT

---

## Dynamic Boosting Rules

### 1. Tight Conjunction to PRIMARY Factor (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Rule**: Any planet conjunct (<3° orb) a PRIMARY factor receives weight boost

**Tiers**:
- **<1° orb**: Elevate to PRIMARY regardless of dignity
- **1-3° orb**: Elevate to SECONDARY minimum

**Rationale**: Tight conjunctions create thematic fusion. The lesser planet MODIFIES the stronger planet's expression. They must be interpreted as a unit.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- Chiron 18°49' Cancer conjunct Sun 19°25' Cancer (0.36° orb) in 10th house
- Chiron 18°49' Cancer conjunct Jupiter 21°37' Cancer (2.88° orb) in 10th house
- **Boost**: Chiron elevated from TERTIARY to PRIMARY
- **Synthesis**: "Jupiter exalted in 10th conjunct Chiron creates wounded teacher archetype - teaching gifts inseparable from career wound"

**Application**: Always discuss conjunct planets as thematic pair, not separately.

---

### 2. Sect Light Configuration (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Rule**: Planets conjunct the sect light receive illumination boost

**Sect light definition**:
- Day chart: Sun
- Night chart: Moon

**Tiers**:
- **<1° orb to sect light**: Elevate to PRIMARY
- **1-3° orb to sect light**: Elevate to SECONDARY minimum
- **Opposition to sect light**: SECONDARY (tension with identity)

**Rationale**: The sect light is the PRIMARY luminary representing core identity. Anything conjunct it is "illuminated" and given visibility/importance.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- Day chart, Sun is sect light
- Chiron conjunct Sun (0.36° orb) - elevated to PRIMARY
- Jupiter conjunct Sun (2.53° orb) - already PRIMARY due to exaltation, but this confirms importance

**This rule reinforces Rule #1 (conjunction boosting) when the PRIMARY factor is the sect light.**

---

### 3. Stellium/Cluster Amplification (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Rule**: Multiple planets (3+) in same house or sign create concentrated energy

**Tiers**:
- **3+ planets in angular house**: All participating planets SECONDARY minimum
- **Stellium ruled by strong planet**: Ruler's importance amplified
- **Tight stellium (<10° spread)**: Treat as single PRIMARY unit

**Rationale**: Multiple testimonies in same area compound importance. Stellium planets MUST be discussed together as thematic cluster.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- Cancer 10th house stellium: Sun 19° + Mercury 29° + Jupiter 21° (10° spread)
- All three planets SECONDARY minimum (already exceed this due to angular + dignities)
- Ruled by Moon in Pisces 6th - connects career to daily service
- **Synthesis**: "Public identity centers on nurturing teaching through compassionate service"

---

### 4. Mutual Reception Patterns (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Rule**: When two planets are in each other's dignities, they help each other despite challenging placements

**Types**:
- **Strong reception** (both domicile): Both planets SECONDARY minimum
- **Mixed reception** (domicile + exaltation): Stronger planet SECONDARY
- **Weak reception** (triplicity/bounds): Minor boost only if angular

**Rationale**: Traditional texts emphasize mutual reception as mitigation. Planets "help" each other through exchanged rulership.

**Example (hypothetical)**:
- Mars in Libra (detriment) + Venus in Aries (detriment)
- Both cadent and weak by dignity = would be TERTIARY
- **With mutual reception**: Both elevated to SECONDARY
- **Synthesis**: "Relationship challenges mitigated by mutual understanding and exchange"

**Note**: Sam's chart has NO mutual reception. Venus in Gemini (ruled by Mercury) + Mercury in Cancer (ruled by Moon) - no exchange.

---

### 5. Malefic Contrary to Sect (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Rule**: The "worst" malefic receives automatic attention for life challenges

**Definition**:
- Day chart: Mars is malefic contrary to sect (Saturn is malefic of sect)
- Night chart: Saturn is malefic contrary to sect (Mars is malefic of sect)

**Tiers**:
- **Malefic contrary to sect + angular**: PRIMARY for challenges
- **Malefic contrary to sect + cadent**: SECONDARY minimum for challenges
- **Malefic of sect**: TERTIARY if cadent/peregrine (less harsh)

**Rationale**: Sect analysis shows malefic contrary to sect is primary source of difficulty, regardless of dignity.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- Day chart, Mars is malefic contrary to sect
- Mars in Aries 7th house (domicile + angular) = PRIMARY challenge
- **Already correctly weighted** - confirms methodology

---

### 6. House Ruler in Critical House (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Rule**: Rulers of angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) receive minimum weights regardless of their own condition

**Tiers**:
- **Chart ruler (ASC)**: ALWAYS PRIMARY
- **MC ruler**: ALWAYS PRIMARY
- **DSC ruler**: SECONDARY minimum
- **IC ruler**: SECONDARY minimum

**Rationale**: House rulers are PRIMARY testimony regardless of the ruler's condition. They determine WHERE and HOW life themes unfold.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- Chart ruler: Venus (rules Libra ASC)
- Venus in Gemini 9th house (peregrine, feral, cadent)
- **Static weight**: TERTIARY
- **Dynamic boost**: PRIMARY (chart ruler)
- **Correctly handled in current system**

---

### 7. Aspect Pattern Geometry (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Rule**: Major aspect patterns (T-squares, Grand Trines, Grand Crosses, Yods) create thematic coherence

**Tiers**:
- **T-Square/Grand Cross**: All participating planets SECONDARY minimum (dynamic tension)
- **Grand Trine**: All participating planets SECONDARY if in strong houses (flow)
- **Yod**: Apex planet SECONDARY (point of release)

**Rationale**: Aspect patterns show life THEMES that transcend individual planet strength. The configuration itself is significant.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- T-Square: Jupiter 21° Cancer opposite Saturn 22° Capricorn, squared by Mars 29° Aries
- **Issue**: Mars square is wide (7-8° orb) - borderline for classical aspects
- **But**: Jupiter-Saturn opposition (0.53° orb) is PRIMARY
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge T-Square pattern in synthesis even with wide Mars square, as it shows expansion/contraction tension activated through assertive action

---

### 8. Bonification Patterns (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Rule**: When benefic (Venus/Jupiter) aspects malefic (Mars/Saturn), the benefic mitigates harm

**Application**:
- **Benefic applying aspect to malefic**: Discuss as thematic pair
- **Example**: Jupiter sextile Saturn = expansion helps structure
- **Weight impact**: Both planets discussed together (PRIMARY + SECONDARY = joint analysis)

**Rationale**: Hellenistic texts emphasize benefics "helping" malefics through aspect, changing the quality of expression.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- Jupiter opposition Saturn (0.53° orb)
- Both PRIMARY factors, opposition creates tension not mitigation
- No direct bonification, but the opposition itself shows productive expansion/discipline tension

---

### 9. Final Disposition Chains (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Rule**: Trace planetary rulership chains to identify "final dispositor" - planet that ultimately rules chart

**Tiers**:
- **Final dispositor**: Automatic PRIMARY
- **Planets in chain leading to final dispositor**: SECONDARY
- **Planets outside chain**: No boost

**Rationale**: Traditional texts identify the planet in its own domicile that rules all others as "Lord of the Geniture" - exceptionally important.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- Saturn in Capricorn (domicile) rules nothing else
- Mars in Aries (domicile) rules Venus (Aries ASC) → Venus rules nothing in Aries/Taurus
- Jupiter in Cancer (exaltation, not domicile) - cannot be final dispositor
- **No clear final dispositor** in Sam's chart
- **But**: Mars ruling ASC ruler Venus is significant

**Recommendation**: MEDIUM priority; requires complex calculation, moderate impact.

---

### 10. Critical Degrees (LOW PRIORITY)

**Rule**: Planets at 0°, 29°, or Aries Point (0° cardinal signs) have specialized energy

**Tiers**:
- **29° (Anaretic) + angular**: Minor boost to SECONDARY (crisis/completion)
- **0° + angular**: Minor boost to SECONDARY (pure sign energy)
- **Aries Point (0° Aries/Libra/Cancer/Capricorn)**: Only if conjunct angle

**Rationale**: Minimal emphasis in Hellenistic texts; more modern interpretation.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- Mercury at 29°24' Cancer in 10th house
- Already angular and part of PRIMARY stellium
- No additional boost needed

**Recommendation**: LOW priority; apply only if planet would otherwise be TERTIARY and is angular at critical degree.

---

### 11. Antiscia/Contra-antiscia (LOW PRIORITY)

**Rule**: Mirror degrees across solstice/equinox axes create hidden symmetry

**Tiers**:
- **Antiscion/contra-antiscion conjunct angular planet** (<2° orb): Minor boost to SECONDARY
- **Wider orbs**: No boost

**Rationale**: Medieval technique showing hidden connections; useful for depth but not primary testimony.

**Example (Sam's chart)**:
- Mars contra-antiscion at 0°34' Pisces conjunct Moon at 2°38' Pisces (2° orb)
- "Hidden aggressive protection of emotional vulnerability"
- Currently mentioned in process file but could be emphasized more
- **Moon** is ruler of 10th house stellium (Cancer planets) - already significant

**Recommendation**: LOW priority; apply only if <2° orb to angular planet. Useful for synthesis depth, not primary weighting.

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Essential Rules (Implement Immediately)
1. ✅ **Tight conjunction to PRIMARY factor** (<3° orb boosts to SECONDARY/PRIMARY)
2. ✅ **Sect light configuration** (conjunctions to Sun/Moon get illumination)
3. ✅ **Stellium amplification** (3+ planets in angular house = SECONDARY minimum)
4. ✅ **House ruler minimums** (chart ruler PRIMARY, MC ruler PRIMARY, DSC/IC rulers SECONDARY)
5. ✅ **Malefic contrary to sect** (automatic SECONDARY minimum for challenges)
6. **Mutual reception** (both planets SECONDARY when in each other's dignities)

### Phase 2: Intermediate Rules (Implement After Testing)
7. **Aspect pattern geometry** (T-squares, Grand Trines elevate participants)
8. **Bonification patterns** (benefic helping malefic = discuss as pair)
9. **Final disposition chains** (final dispositor = PRIMARY)

### Phase 3: Refinement Rules (Optional Depth)
10. **Critical degrees** (29°, 0° + angular = minor boost)
11. **Antiscia** (<2° orb to angular planet = minor boost)

## DYNAMIC WEIGHT ADJUSTMENTS

While the hierarchical testimony framework provides base weights, apply these dynamic boosts when planets participate in significant configurations:

### 1. Tight Conjunction to PRIMARY Factor
When a planet (regardless of dignity) is conjunct (<3° orb) a PRIMARY factor:
- **<1° orb**: Treat as PRIMARY - analyze as UNIT with the PRIMARY factor
- **1-3° orb**: Treat as SECONDARY minimum - integrate into PRIMARY factor interpretation

**Critical synthesis rule**: DO NOT discuss them separately. The conjunction IS the theme.

Example: "Jupiter exalted 10th conjunct Chiron (0.36° orb) creates wounded teacher archetype - teaching gifts inseparable from career wound"

### 2. Sect Light Illumination
Planets conjunct the sect light (Sun in day chart, Moon in night chart):
- **<1° orb**: Elevate to PRIMARY (illuminated identity)
- **1-3° orb**: Elevate to SECONDARY minimum (visible expression)

### 3. Stellium Amplification
When 3+ planets occupy same angular house:
- All participating planets: SECONDARY minimum
- Discuss as thematic cluster, not individually
- Note stellium ruler's connection (where the energy flows)

### 4. Mutual Reception
When two planets are in each other's dignities:
- **Strong reception** (both domicile): Both SECONDARY minimum
- Discuss as cooperative pair mitigating difficult placements

### 5. House Ruler Minimums (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
- Chart ruler: ALWAYS PRIMARY
- MC ruler: ALWAYS PRIMARY
- DSC/IC rulers: SECONDARY minimum

### 6. Malefic Contrary to Sect (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
- Day chart: Mars = SECONDARY minimum for challenges (PRIMARY if angular)
- Night chart: Saturn = SECONDARY minimum for challenges (PRIMARY if angular)
```

## Testing Plan

### Test Case 1: Sam P's Chart
**Before dynamic weighting**:
- Chiron in Cancer 10th: TERTIARY (peregrine, modern planet)

**After dynamic weighting**:
- Chiron conjunct Sun (0.36° orb) in 10th: **PRIMARY** (tight conjunction to sect light + stellium participation)
- Chiron conjunct Jupiter (2.88° orb) exalted 10th: **PRIMARY** (tight conjunction to PRIMARY factor)

**Expected synthesis change**:
- OLD: Jupiter exalted in 10th suggests teaching gifts (mentions Chiron as footnote)
- NEW: "Jupiter exalted conjunct Chiron in 10th creates wounded teacher archetype - career wound IS the teaching gift. Public identity centers on healing through shared vulnerability."

### Test Case 2: Mutual Reception (Hypothetical)
**Setup**: Mars in Libra 5th (detriment, cadent) + Venus in Aries 11th (detriment, cadent)

**Before**: Both TERTIARY (weak dignity, cadent houses)

**After**: Both SECONDARY (mutual reception boost)

**Expected synthesis**: "Creative expression (5th) and community belonging (11th) mutually support each other through relationship challenges - social connection fuels artistic work, art builds friendships"

### Test Case 3: T-Square
**Setup**: Sun-Saturn opposition squared by Mars

**Before**: Emphasize opposition primarily, Mars square as secondary

**After**: Acknowledge T-Square as PRIMARY pattern showing expansion/contraction activated through assertive action

**Expected synthesis**: "Central life tension shows expansion-discipline dynamic (Sun-Saturn) requiring assertive action (Mars square) to navigate"

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Chiron interpretation accuracy**: Sam's wounded teacher archetype should be PRIMARY theme, not footnote
2. **Synthesis coherence**: Tight conjunctions discussed as UNITS, not separate factors
3. **Pattern recognition**: T-squares, stelliums, mutual receptions acknowledged as PRIMARY patterns
4. **User validation**: Generated reports accurately reflect life experience when tight configurations present
