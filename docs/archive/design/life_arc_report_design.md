## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive design for a **Life Arc Report** system that generates personalized life timeline narratives from birth to age 100, combining six predictive techniques from traditional and modern astrology. The report provides both a narrative synthesis PDF (for the native to understand their life story) and a technical document (containing full calculation data).

### Core Innovation

Unlike existing transit or progression reports that focus on near-term predictions, the Life Arc Report presents the **archetypal structure of a person's entire life** - answering questions like:

- When do major life chapters begin and end?
- When does professional success typically manifest?
- When do relationship opportunities peak?
- When do struggles ease or intensify?
- What is the overarching narrative of this life?

## 1. Literature Review Findings

### 1.1 Zodiacal Releasing (Primary Framework)

**Source**: Hellenistic Astrology (Chris Brennan), pages 554-591

**Key Findings**:

1. **Life as Chapters**: Zodiacal releasing divides life into distinct periods and subperiods based on lots (Spirit for career/mind, Fortune for body/livelihood)

2. **General Periods**: Each sign gets assigned years (Aries 15, Taurus 8, Gemini 20, Cancer 25, Scorpio 15, Sagittarius 12, Capricorn 27, Aquarius 30, Pisces 12, Virgo 20, Libra 8, Leo 19)

3. **Subperiods**: Each general period divides into subperiods (months) following the same sign sequence

4. **Peak Periods (Critical Importance)**:
   - When a Level 1 (general period) and Level 2 (subperiod) match the SAME sign
   - Example: Level 1 = Aries, Level 2 = Aries within that Aries period
   - These are the most active and important times - "doubly activated"
   - NOT necessarily positive or negative - just intensified

5. **Loosing of the Bond (Major Transitions)**:
   - When subperiods complete a full zodiacal cycle, instead of returning to the starting sign, they "jump" to the opposite sign
   - Indicates major, sometimes abrupt, life transitions
   - Context matters: occurring in angular houses = major career shifts; succedent = consolidation; cadent = preparatory phases
   - Often coincides with Saturn returns, major outer planet transits

6. **Quality Determination**:
   - (1) Nature of planets in the activated sign
   - (2) Nature of planets configured (aspecting) the activated sign, especially squares/oppositions
   - (3) Condition of the ruler of the activated sign
   - (4) Whether ruler is in sect or contrary to sect

**Quote from Research**:
> "Peak periods are more active and important, but not necessarily positive or negative. The main considerations which determine what the quality of the period will be like are (1) the nature of any natal planets placed in the sign that has become activated, (2) the nature of any natal planets configured to the sign, especially by square or opposition..."

### 1.2 Progressed Lunation Cycle (Emotional Framework)

**Source**: Astrology and the Authentic Self (Demetra George), pages 138-143

**Key Findings**:

1. **29.5-Year Cycle**: Progressed Sun-Moon cycle = complete archetypal life phase
   - New Moon to New Moon = one complete emotional/developmental cycle
   - Approximately 29-30 years (same as Saturn return period)

2. **Eight Phases** (each ~3.5-4 years):
   - **New Moon** (0-45°): New beginnings, planting seeds, fresh start
   - **Crescent** (45-90°): Struggle, breaking through, commitment
   - **First Quarter** (90-135°): Crisis of action, push forward or retreat
   - **Gibbous** (135-180°): Refinement, analysis, perfection
   - **Full Moon** (180-225°): Illumination, opposition, culmination, peak manifestation
   - **Disseminating** (225-270°): Sharing, teaching, demonstration
   - **Last Quarter** (270-315°): Crisis of consciousness, reorientation
   - **Balsamic** (315-360°): Release, completion, transition, preparing for rebirth

3. **Integration with Other Techniques**:
   - Saturn transits have different meaning in different lunation phases
   - Example: Saturn to Sun during Full Moon phase = defining identity in relationship; during New Moon = releasing new vision
   - Provides **emotional context** for all other timing techniques

**Quote from Research**:
> "The progressed Sun and the progressed Moon have a thirty-year cycle from one progressed New Moon to another, and each progressed lunation phase lasts about three and a half to four years. They are the successive unfolding stages of one thirty-year cycle of the life purpose."

### 1.3 Saturn Returns (Restructuring Points)

**Source**: Predictive Astrology (Brady), Planets in Transit (Hand)

**Key Findings**:

1. **29-Year Cycles**: Three major returns in typical lifetime
   - **First Return (~age 29)**: "Being measured for realism" - end of youth, acceptance of adult responsibilities
   - **Second Return (~age 58)**: Review of life accomplishments, preparation for elder phase
   - **Third Return (~age 87)**: If reached, wisdom integration, life completion themes

2. **Crisis = Testing**:
   - "Crisis does not mean disaster" - period of testing to determine weak points
   - Productive time if you embrace necessary restructuring
   - Consequences of actions from previous 29 years manifest
   - Can be extremely challenging but transformative

3. **Contraction Phase**:
   - Saturn represents **pulse of contraction** following expansion (Jupiter)
   - Time of pause, consolidation, restraint, testing
   - Acceptance of consequences

### 1.4 Jupiter Returns (Growth Cycles)

**Source**: Planets in Transit (Hand)

**Key Findings**:

1. **12-Year Cycles**: Expansion, opportunity, worldview shifts
   - Age 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96
   - Each return = new cycle of growth and learning

2. **Optimism & Confidence**:
   - "You feel better about yourself and your life than at other times"
   - Professional progress, business expansion, recognition
   - Promotion potential, advancement opportunities

3. **Balance with Saturn**:
   - Jupiter = expansion; Saturn = contraction
   - Most people have "adequate dose of Saturn" to avoid Jupiter excess
   - Even difficult Jupiter aspects (square/opposition) are relatively easy

4. **Warning**:
   - Don't exaggerate abilities or overextend
   - Risk of feeling omnipotent (not real to the extent felt)
   - Careful with expansion - don't exhaust yourself

### 1.5 Outer Planet Milestones

**Source**: Planets in Transit (Hand), The Horoscope in Manifestation (Greene)

**Key Findings**:

1. **Uranus Opposition (~age 42)**:
   - Midlife crisis period
   - "You discover that you don't know what you thought you knew"
   - Sudden events that don't fit life patterns
   - Liberating but unsettling - reveals what's been ignored
   - Desire to break from restrictions

2. **Chiron Return (~age 50-51)**:
   - Integration of core wound themes
   - Wounded healer archetype activated
   - Opportunity to transform pain into wisdom

3. **Uranus Return (~age 84)**:
   - If reached, full cycle completion
   - Liberation from conventional life structures
   - Wisdom of authenticity

4. **Neptune/Pluto Cycles**:
   - Too slow for full returns in human lifetime
   - Squares/oppositions mark generational shifts
   - Collective transformation themes

### 1.6 Annual Profections

**Source**: Hellenistic Astrology (Brennan), pages 536-565

**Key Findings**:

1. **Simple 12-Year Cycle**:
   - Age modulo 12 = activated house from Ascendant
   - Age 0-11 activates houses 1-12 in sequence
   - Age 12 returns to house 1, cycle repeats
   - Defines topical focus for each year

2. **Lord of the Year**:
   - Ruler of the activated profection sign becomes primary significator
   - This planet's condition determines quality of year
   - Its transits during that year are especially important

3. **Integration Point**:
   - Profections activate houses ANNUALLY
   - Within each profection year, zodiacal releasing shows monthly themes
   - Lunation cycle shows emotional phase
   - Saturn/Jupiter returns occur within specific profection contexts

## 3. Event Prioritization System

### 3.1 Hierarchy of Significance

The system must distinguish between **major life-defining events** and **minor supportive themes**. Here's the prioritization framework based on research findings:

#### Tier 1: MAJOR LIFE CHAPTERS (Narrative Backbone)

**Zodiacal Releasing - General Period Changes**:
- **Weight**: 10/10
- **Why**: Defines entire life chapters lasting 8-30 years
- **Example**: "Age 29-49: Twenty-year Cancer period focused on home/foundation themes"
- **Display**: Top-level timeline markers, bold chapter headers

**Loosing of the Bond**:
- **Weight**: 10/10
- **Why**: Major, often abrupt transitions between life phases
- **Example**: "Age 42: Loosing of bond from Scorpio to Taurus - career pivot from depth psychology to teaching/stability"
- **Display**: Critical transition points, highlighted markers

**Saturn Returns**:
- **Weight**: 10/10
- **Why**: Restructuring points, major responsibility shifts
- **Example**: "Age 29: First Saturn Return - end of youth, acceptance of adult life structure"
- **Display**: Major milestone markers

---

#### Tier 2: SIGNIFICANT MILESTONES (Chapter Markers)

**Zodiacal Releasing - Peak Periods (L1/L2 match)**:
- **Weight**: 9/10
- **Why**: Most active/important times within a chapter
- **Example**: "Age 35-37: Aries L1/L2 peak period - career breakthrough with Mars activation"
- **Display**: Highlighted within chapter timelines

**Jupiter Returns**:
- **Weight**: 8/10
- **Why**: Growth cycles, expansion, opportunity windows
- **Example**: "Age 36: Third Jupiter Return - professional expansion, worldview shift"
- **Display**: Cycle markers within chapters

**Outer Planet Milestones** (Uranus opposition, Chiron return):
- **Weight**: 8/10
- **Why**: Generational shifts, consciousness evolution
- **Example**: "Age 42: Uranus opposition - midlife liberation, authentic self emergence"
- **Display**: Special markers, distinct from planetary returns

**Progressed Lunation Phase Changes**:
- **Weight**: 8/10
- **Why**: Shifts in emotional/developmental approach every ~3.5 years
- **Example**: "Age 32-36: Progressed Full Moon phase - culmination, peak visibility"
- **Display**: Background color coding or phase indicators

---

#### Tier 3: ANNUAL THEMES (Supportive Context)

**Profection Year Changes**:
- **Weight**: 6/10
- **Why**: Defines topical focus year by year
- **Example**: "Age 35: 12th house profection (Cancer) - introspection, healing themes; Moon is lord of year"
- **Display**: Minimal in synthesis (maybe every 12 years for Jupiter cycle alignment); full detail in technical doc

**Zodiacal Releasing - Subperiod (L2) Changes**:
- **Weight**: 6/10
- **Why**: Monthly/sub-annual themes within chapters
- **Example**: "Within 35-37 peak period: Cancer subperiod Jun-Nov 2023 brings emotional processing"
- **Display**: Technical document only (too granular for synthesis narrative)

---

#### Tier 4: TRANSIENT THEMES (Technical Detail Only)

**Zodiacal Releasing - L3/L4 Subperiods**:
- **Weight**: 4/10
- **Why**: Weekly/daily precision - useful for exact timing but overwhelming in overview
- **Display**: Technical document only, not in synthesis

---

### 3.2 Event Combination Rules

**Rule 1: Convergence Amplifies Significance**

When multiple Tier 1-2 events occur simultaneously (within 1-2 years), significance multiplies:

**Example**:
- Age 29: Saturn return + Loosing of bond + Progressed lunation shift = **MAJOR TRANSITION POINT**
- Weight: 10 + 10 + 8 = 28 (flag as "Critical Life Pivot")

**Rule 2: Context Determines Quality**

The same event type has different significance based on natal context:

**Zodiacal Releasing Period Activation**:
- Sign contains benefic planets (Jupiter/Venus) = positive manifestation
- Sign contains malefic planets (Mars/Saturn) = challenging manifestation
- Sign contains natal angles or lot placements = heightened importance
- Ruler of sign is in sect = easier expression; contrary to sect = more difficult

**Example for Darren**:
- Capricorn period activation: Contains Sun/Mercury/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune = MASSIVELY SIGNIFICANT
- These planets in 6th house = work, service, health themes dominate
- Saturn in domicile = structured, disciplined manifestation
- Benefic of sect (Venus) absent = must work through challenges

**Rule 3: Integration Synthesis**

Each major event should reference:
1. Which zodiacal releasing chapter it occurs within
2. Which progressed lunation phase it occurs during
3. Whether Saturn/Jupiter cycles support or challenge it
4. Relevant profection year themes (if applicable)

**Example Integration**:
> "Age 42 (Loosing of Bond - Tier 1): You experience a major career pivot from Scorpio intensity to Taurus stability. This occurs during your Progressed Gibbous phase (refinement/analysis period) and coincides with your Uranus opposition (midlife liberation). Within your 7th house profection year, this transformation impacts partnerships as you redefine your relationship to work-life balance. Mars, ruler of your Aries 9th house, becomes highly active."

## 5. Visual Timeline Recommendations

### 5.1 Research Findings on Timeline Visualization

The literature doesn't provide specific examples of life arc timelines, but based on:
- The structure of zodiacal releasing (nested periods)
- The cyclical nature of Jupiter/Saturn returns
- The phase progression of lunation cycles

I recommend a **multi-layer horizontal timeline** design.

---

### 5.2 Proposed Timeline Design

**Format**: Horizontal timeline from left (birth) to right (age 100)

**Layers** (stacked vertically):

#### **Layer 1: Life Decades** (Top)
```

**Ages 21-30: The Gemini Exploration Chapter**

**Zodiacal Releasing Context** (Spirit - Career/Mind):
During this decade, you move through the latter part of your Taurus general period (2003-2011, ages 15-23) and into the powerful Gemini period (2011-2031, ages 23-43). Taurus, ruled by Venus in your 5th house (benefic of sect), brings creative expression and pleasure-seeking to your vocational development. The shift to Gemini in 2011 marks a major twenty-year chapter focused on communication, learning, and intellectual versatility.

**Developmental Themes**:
You navigate multiple progressed lunation phases during this decade:
- **Progressed Last Quarter Phase** (ages 21-25): Crisis of consciousness, reorientation of values
- **Progressed Balsamic Phase** (ages 25-29): Release, completion, preparing for rebirth
- **Progressed New Moon** (August 2018, age 29.7): Fresh start, planting seeds for next 30 years

This is a decade of intellectual growth, career experimentation, and gradual shedding of youthful illusions in preparation for your Saturn return.

**Major Events**:
- **Second Jupiter Return** (June 2012, age 23.4): Expansion of worldview, educational opportunities
- **Entry into Gemini Period** (December 2011, age 23): Communication and learning become central vocational themes

**CRITICAL LIFE PIVOT: First Saturn Return (Age 29)**

**Timing**: December 2017 - March 2020 (exact conjunctions: January, May, December 2018)

**Context**:
This is one of the most significant transitions in your life - a convergence of three major cycles:

1. **Saturn Return**: Your natal Saturn in Capricorn (6th house, domicile, conjunct Sun) returns for the first time. Saturn demands you accept the consequences of the previous 29 years and commit to adult responsibilities.

2. **Progressed New Moon** (August 2018): A fresh 30-year lunation cycle begins simultaneously with your Saturn return. This is extraordinarily rare timing - your emotional/developmental rebirth coincides exactly with your structural maturation.

3. **Profection to 6th House**: Age 29 activates your natal 6th house (Capricorn), making Saturn - already returning - your lord of the year. Saturn is DOUBLY activated: by return and by profection rulership.

**Quality**:
Your 6th house contains an extraordinary stellium: Sun, Mercury, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, all in Capricorn. This is where your identity (Sun), communication (Mercury), discipline (Saturn), innovation (Uranus), and spiritual ideals (Neptune) converge around themes of work, service, health, and daily routines.

Saturn's return to its own domicile (Capricorn) where it rules gives you STRENGTH through this transition. You're not fighting against Saturn - you're learning to embody its highest expression: maturity, mastery, enduring achievement. However, the Capricorn 6th house emphasis suggests this maturation happens through work challenges, health awareness, and service obligations.

**Zodiacal Releasing**: You're in the middle of your Gemini general period (2011-2031), likely activating Virgo or Libra subperiods. The Mercury/Venus themes (communication, relationship, balance) provide context for how Saturn's discipline manifests.

**Themes**:
- **End of Youth**: The carefree exploration of your twenties gives way to committed adult structure
- **Work/Career Solidification**: Your Capricorn stellium in the 6th demands you find meaningful, disciplined work that serves a larger purpose
- **Health Restructuring**: 6th house activation may bring health awareness - establishing sustainable routines becomes essential
- **Seed Planting**: The simultaneous Progressed New Moon asks: "What do I want to build over the next 30 years?" Your answer at age 29 sets the foundation for your life until age 59.

**Integration**:
The Balsamic phase (ages 25-29) prepared you by releasing what no longer serves. Now, at the New Moon, you plant seeds. Saturn ensures those seeds are realistic, viable, and aligned with your true calling - not fantasies, but achievable visions you're willing to work for.

With Mars in Aries (9th house, domicile) trine your Moon and Ascendant, you have the courage and philosophical conviction to embrace this restructuring. Your Leo Ascendant demands you lead, not follow. The Saturn return teaches you to lead with maturity, not just charisma.

**Practical Guidance**:
- Embrace responsibility rather than resisting it
- Your Capricorn planets want to BUILD something lasting
- Health and daily routines need attention - establish sustainable practices
- What you commit to at 29 will shape your entire thirties and forties
- The New Moon phase favors new beginnings, not rehashing the past

5. CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS
   Events Within 2-Year Window (Age 28-30):
     - First Saturn Return (multiple exact passes): Tier 1, Weight 10
     - Progressed New Moon (30-yr cycle): Tier 2, Weight 8
     - 6th House Profection (Saturn lord of year): Tier 3, Weight 6
     - Zodiacal Releasing - Mercury double activation: Tier 2, Weight 7

   Combined Significance Score: 10 + 8 + 6 + 7 = 31/40
   Classification: CRITICAL LIFE PIVOT (score ≥ 25)

   Convergence Themes:
     - Work/Service (6th house emphasis)
     - Maturity/Responsibility (Saturn return)
     - Communication/Learning (Mercury activation)
     - New Beginning (Progressed New Moon)
     - Health/Daily Routine (6th house + Virgo L2)

6. QUALITY ASSESSMENT
   Activated Signs:
     - Capricorn (Saturn return house, profection house): HIGHLY ACTIVATED
       Contains: Sun, Mercury, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune (5 planets!)
       Quality: Ambitious, disciplined, responsible, structured, achiever energy
       Sect Status: Saturn in sect (diurnal would be contrary, but this is nocturnal chart)
                    Actually NOCTURNAL chart, so Saturn is CONTRARY to sect (harder)

     - Virgo (L2 subperiod): ACTIVE
       Contains: (No natal planets, but Virgo on 2nd house cusp)
       Ruler: Mercury in Capricorn 6th
       Quality: Analytical, service-oriented, health-focused, practical

   Ruler Conditions:
     Saturn (lord of year, returning planet):
       Essential Dignity: Domicile in Capricorn (strongest dignity)
       Accidental Dignity: 6th house (cadent, but joyful in its traditional place)
       Aspects: Conjunction Sun (0°52'), conjunction Uranus (3°34')
       Speed: Direct motion (forward-moving)
       Sect: Contrary to sect (nocturnal chart, Saturn is diurnal malefic)
             → Harder Saturn expression, must work through challenges
       Overall: STRONG but DEMANDING (domicile + contrary to sect = empowered challenge)

     Mercury (ZR L1 and L2 ruler):
       Essential Dignity: Triplicity in Capricorn (earth triplicity, decent dignity)
       Accidental: 6th house (cadent)
       Aspects: Square Mars (2°31' separating)
       Speed: Direct
       Sect: Neutral (Mercury adapts)
       Overall: MODERATE strength, challenged by Mars square (communication friction)

   Benefic/Malefic Analysis:
     Benefics Active: Venus rules upcoming Libra L2 (post-Saturn return relief)
     Malefics Active: Saturn (primary), Mars (challenging Mercury)
     Balance: MALEFIC-DOMINANT during Saturn return year → challenges, tests, discipline

7. INTERPRETATION SYNTHESIS
   Primary Theme: MATURATION THROUGH WORK AND SERVICE

   The convergence of Saturn's return in your packed 6th house Capricorn stellium with
   the beginning of a new 30-year progressed lunation cycle creates a DEFINITIVE
   MATURATION POINT. You are not just experiencing a Saturn return - you're experiencing
   a Saturn return in Saturn's own sign, in the house of work/service, while Mercury
   (your zodiacal releasing ruler) is simultaneously activated through double-rulership.

   This is a period of:
   - Accepting adult responsibility through meaningful work
   - Establishing daily routines and health practices that will sustain you
   - Committing to a vocational path aligned with your Capricorn drive to build/achieve
   - Releasing youthful fantasies in favor of realistic, achievable goals
   - Planting seeds (Progressed New Moon) that will germinate over the next 30 years

   Because Saturn is contrary to sect (nocturnal chart), this maturation comes through
   CHALLENGE rather than ease. You must WORK for what you achieve - nothing is handed
   to you. However, Saturn's domicile position gives you the CAPACITY to do this work.
   You have the discipline, structure, and endurance required.

   The Mercury activation (ruling both Gemini L1 and Virgo L2) suggests your maturation
   involves communication, learning, analysis, and service. The Mars square to Mercury
   indicates you must fight for your voice, defend your ideas, and overcome intellectual
   challenges.

   The shift from Virgo L2 (analytical, service) to Libra L2 (relationship, balance)
   in December 2018 - right after the final Saturn conjunction - suggests relief comes
   through partnerships and creative expression (Venus in 5th house, benefic of sect).

8. PRACTICAL GUIDANCE
   DO:
   - Embrace work challenges as opportunities to prove your competence
   - Establish sustainable health and daily routines NOW (they'll serve you for decades)
   - Commit to a vocational path - even if imperfect, commitment matters
   - Use Mercury's analytical power to assess what's working vs. what's not
   - Lean on Venus (benefic of sect) for creative relief and relationship support

   DON'T:
   - Avoid responsibility or try to stay in your twenties
   - Overwork to the point of health breakdown (6th house warning)
   - Ignore health issues that arise (Saturn teaches through the body)
   - Give up when challenges feel overwhelming (Saturn tests endurance)
   - Expect ease - this is a working transit, not a lucky one

   TIMING:
   - Hardest periods: Jan-May 2018, Aug-Dec 2018 (exact Saturn conjunctions)
   - Relief: Dec 2018 onward (Libra L2, Venus themes, post-return)
   - Peak intensity: August 2018 (Saturn return + Progressed New Moon simultaneous)

## 8. Key Design Decisions Summary

### 8.1 Scope Choices

**Included**:
- 6 predictive techniques (zodiacal releasing, progressed lunations, Saturn returns, Jupiter returns, outer planet milestones, profections)
- 10 lots/parts (Fortune, Spirit, Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory, Basis, Exaltation, Marriage, Children)
- Birth to age 100 timeline
- Synthesis PDF + Technical Document outputs
- Visual timeline graphics

**Excluded** (for now):
- Transits (focus on arc structure, not current transits - that's transit analyzer's job)
- Progressions beyond lunation cycle (no aspect progressions, angle progressions - too complex for MVP)
- Solar/lunar returns (annual events - too granular for life arc overview)
- Antiscia, harmonics, advanced techniques

**Rationale**: Focus on archetypal life STRUCTURE (major chapters, pivots) rather than short-term prediction. Keep MVP manageable while delivering transformative insight.

---

### 8.2 Prioritization Philosophy

**Tier 1-4 System**:
- Prevents information overload
- Focuses synthesis on what matters most
- Allows technical document to contain everything
- Gives user digestible narrative without sacrificing completeness

**Quality Over Quantity**:
- 15-25 page synthesis (readable in one sitting)
- 5-8 critical pivots (memorable, actionable)
- Highlights only approach prevents "wall of text" overwhelm

---

### 8.3 Lots Selection

**Primary (Fortune/Spirit)**: Non-negotiable, foundation of zodiacal releasing

**Extended (Eros, Necessity, Courage, Victory)**: Traditional Hellenistic lots, well-documented

**Recommended (Exaltation, Marriage)**: Relevant to Darren's specific themes (Capricorn career drive, 7th house relationship challenges)

**Conditional (Children)**: Only if user interested (not everyone wants/has children)

**Rationale**: Balance between traditional completeness and personal relevance. All formulas sourced from Hellenistic tradition (Valens, Brennan).

---

### 8.4 Narrative vs. Technical Split

**Synthesis = Story**:
- Archetypal, inspirational, readable
- Plain language, no jargon unless explained
- For the native to understand their life

**Technical = Data**:
- Complete calculations, all tiers
- For validation, research, detailed study
- For astrologers and technically minded users

**Rationale**: Different audiences, different needs. One report serves both.

---

### 8.5 Implementation Priorities

**Stage 1 (Calculation) FIRST**:
- Without accurate calculations, nothing else matters
- Test rigorously with Darren's chart
- Validate against Brennan's examples and Swiss Ephemeris

**Stage 3 (Narrative) BEFORE Stage 5 (Visualization)**:
- Narrative is the core user value
- Visuals enhance but aren't essential for MVP
- Can iterate on graphics after proving narrative works

**Agent (Stage 7) LAST**:
- Needs complete system to work from
- Workflow should be proven before agent automates it
